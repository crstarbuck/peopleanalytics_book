Data visualization is heavily dependent on the type of data being presented, key messages that need to be conveyed, the unique characteristics of the audience to whom information needs to be communicated, and various contextual features germane to a proper interpretation and understanding of material. This chapter will provide general best practices as well as strategies specific to various types of data that will promote success when communicating data to technical and non-technical stakeholders alike. 15.1 Best Practices While the type of visual depends on the nature of data being presented, there are general best practices for effectively communicating information that are applicable for all data types, audiences, and contexts. 15.1.1 Color Palette There are several important considerations when choosing colors for data visualization. Color has meaning. The meaning of color is not consistent across the world. For example, in Western cultures red generally has unfavorable connotations (e.g., off track, danger) while green signals a favorable status (e.g., on track, cash flow positive). However, in Asian cultures red indicates success. It is important to understand what color indicates in the contexts in which information is shared to ensure color choices are consistent with the messages that need to be conveyed. Respect color blindness. Most estimates indicate that 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women (0.5%) are colorblind (~4.5% of the world population). Males are more likely to be colorblind because the X chromosome contains the genes responsible for the most common forms of color blindness. Trouble distinguishing between red and green is the most common manifestation of colorblindness (Gordon, 1998). This has important implications for data visualization, and it is generally best to avoid the use of red and green. One alternative is to leverage orange to indicate unfavorable data points and blue for favorable. This strategy will be implemented throughout this chapter. Adhere to brand colors. In most organizations, the marketing team defines a color palette consistent with the branding used for consumer products and services. In this case, analysts may be constrained to the use of colors within the branding palette. Be sure to consult with marketing colleagues and adhere to any color palette requirements. Use color consistently. To support a correct interpretation of information, it is important to use a consistent color scheme across the various visuals in dashboards, slides, and documents. For example, if blue is assigned to highlight how the Engineering department compares to other departments in a particular view, blue should be assigned to the Engineering department in every view in which department is a grouping dimension. The consistent use of color requires the audience to wield less effort to understand information, which in turn reduces the risk of incorrect interpretation. 15.1.2 Chart Borders The goal in data visualization is to enable the most important data to take center stage. Formatting should support – not detract – from this objective. Chart borders are a usual suspect and prime example of formatting that can divert focus away from the data. Figure 15.1 illustrates the use of heavy and light borders for a tabular presentation of data. Formatting takes center stage in the first table due to heavy borders, while formatting is not the focus in the second table given the minimal light grey border. Figure 15.1: Comparison of data tables with heavy (left) and light (right) borders. 15.1.3 Preattentive Attributes Preattentive attributes signal where to look and help our audience focus on content we wish to emphasize (Knaflic, 2015). It is important to remember that data do not always need to be visualized with a chart. Sometimes communicating with text is a sufficient and effective way to convey information. In the case of text, preattentive attributes are often implemented using bold text and/or contrasting colors for keywords and phrases that need to take center stage. Bolded text is generally more effective than italizing or , as it highlights the chosen elements without unnecessary noise and compromising legibility. Grey is an important color in the implementation of preattentive attributes as it facilitates a move of less important data and design elements to the background to make room for more predominate colors to highlight the most important information. Figure 15.2 illustrates the application of preattentive attributes to emphasize the key message in a sentence. This is accomplished by pushing the less important content to the background using grey text and using bold orange text to highlight the labor cost increase. Figure 15.2: The application of preattentive attributes to highlight labor costs as a key driver of operating cost increases. Preattentive attributes can also be applied to data visualizations to focus the audience’s attention. Figure 15.3 illustrates the use of preattentive attributes by assigning a different color (orange) to the labor cost for the current year and muting the labor costs associated with prior years using a less predominate grey. Figure 15.3: The application of preattentive attributes to highlight labor costs for the current year relative to prior years. Simply put, if something is really important, make sure it is different from other content on the page, slide, or section. 15.2 Beyond the Defaults Software knows neither what we wish to highlight nor the audience to whom we intend to communicate the information. Therefore, regardless of the software, design defaults are rarely best. This section will implement data visualization best practices step-by-step beginning with the design defaults for the ggplot2 library. 15.2.1 Step 1: Build Bar Chart with Defaults We will begin by building a bar chart that shows the distribution of active employees’ educational backgrounds. To simplify the data structure for data visualization, let’s ingest our employees data and create an aggregated cube with counts by ed_field for active employees: # Load library library(dplyr) # Load data employees &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crstarbuck/peopleanalytics_book/master/data/employees.csv&quot;) # Create data cube for active employees data &lt;- employees %&gt;% dplyr::filter(active == &#39;Yes&#39;) %&gt;% dplyr::count(ed_field) A bar chart can be created using the geom_bar() function, and we will start with the ggplot2 library’s design defaults: # Visualize data ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = ed_field, y = n, fill = as.factor(ed_field))) + ggplot2::geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) (#fig:barchart_1)Step 1: Bar chart with defaults. 15.2.2 Step 2: Remove Legend Since the legend is not necessary for interpreting the education field to which each bar corresponds, we will remove it using theme(legend.position = \"none\"). Eliminating the legend also provides more real estate for the chart, which helps make the x-axis values more legible. (#fig:barchart_2)Step 3: Remove legend. 15.2.3 Step 3: Assign Colors Strategically There is a lot competing for attention due to this vibrant color palette. Let’s assume that the objective is to highlight the education field pursued by the largest number of employees. Preattentive attributes lends well to this, and we can assign specific hex color codes to the education categories. Since Life Sciences was the field pursued by the most employees, let’s highlight the corresponding bar in blue and move the remaining bars to the background through the assignment of light grey. One method of accomplishing this is via the following explicit category assignments: scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Human Resources\" = \"#BFBFBF\", \"Life Sciences\" = \"#0070C0\", \"Marketing\" = \"#BFBFBF\", \"Medical\" = \"#BFBFBF\", \"Other\" = \"#BFBFBF\", Technical Degree\" = \"#BFBFBF\")) (#fig:barchart_3)Step 3: Assign colors strategically. 15.2.4 Step 4: Add Mixed Case Axis Titles Axis titles are the column names by default, which is usually not the most user-friendly option. We can assign new mixed case axis titles by chaining labs(x = 'Education Field', y = 'Headcount') to the visualization code. (#fig:barchart_4)Step 4: Add mixed case axis titles. 15.2.5 Step 5: Add Left-Justified Title We can add a chart title via labs(title = 'This is a chart title.'). This title can be centered via theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), left justified via theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0), or right justified via theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 1). It is a best practice to left justify titles since readers consume information beginning with the left side of the page (like reading a book), and left justifying the title increases the probability that the audience will read the title and understand its purpose before engaging with the visual. Left justification is the default for ggplot2 titles. It is also a best practice to assign a descriptive title to charts to highlight the key message(s) we want to convey to the audience through the visual. For longer titles, the new line character \\n can be used to break titles into multiple lines. (#fig:barchart_5)Step 5: Add title. 15.2.6 Step 6: Increase Axis Margins Creating a degree of separation between axis titles and the variable’s values helps in reducing clutter and enhancing legibility. We can leverage axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10, r = 10, b = 0, l = 0)) and axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10, r = 10, b = 0, l = 0)) to set the margins around x-axis and y-axis titles, respectively, where: t = top r = right b = bottom l = left (#fig:barchart_6)Step 6: Increase axis margins. 15.2.7 Step 7: Remove Background The default grey background is a distraction from the data we need to take center stage. We can remove this background using panel.background = element_blank() to achieve a cleaner aesthetic and allow the bars in this chart to become more pronounced. (#fig:barchart_7)Step 7: Remove background. 15.2.8 Step 8: Remove Axis Ticks Axis ticks add noise to this visual and are not necessary to ascertain to which values along the axes the data align. Axis ticks can be removed for each axis independently with axis.ticks.x = element_blank() for the x-axis and axis.ticks.y = element_blank() for the y-axis. (#fig:barchart_8)Step 8: Remove axis ticks. 15.2.9 Step 9: Mute Titles While the chart and axis titles are important for clarifying what information is represented in the visual, these should not be the focus. Just as we pushed the less important education categories to the background using grey text, we can mute the chart and axis titles with grey text to help draw attention to the data. We can change the color of the chart title to light grey with plot.title = element_text(colour = \"#404040\"). The axis titles can be changed to the same color using axis.title.x = element_text(colour = \"#404040\") for the x-axis and axis.title.y = element_text(colour = \"#404040\") for the y-axis. (#fig:barchart_9)Step 9: Mute titles. 15.2.10 Step 10: Sort Data along Flipped Axis We can further simplify this visual for our audience by sorting the bars from highest to lowest, and flipping the coordinates of the bar chart. Flipping the coordinates allows the audience to more easily scan down the right side of the visual to quickly identify and understand the relative frequencies of education categories. We can use dplyr to sort the data and define the levels of ed_field. # Sort education values by avg annual comp data &lt;- data %&gt;% dplyr::arrange(n) data$ed_field &lt;- factor(data$ed_field, levels = data$ed_field) We can now visualize the sorted data with flipped coordinates using coord_flip(): (#fig:barchart_10)Step 10: Sort data along flipped axis. The final visual is a significant improvement over the design defaults in step 1. viz_pre &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = ed_field, y = n, fill = as.factor(ed_field))) + ggplot2::geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) viz_post &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = ed_field, y = n, fill = as.factor(ed_field))) + ggplot2::geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + ggplot2::coord_flip() + ggplot2::labs(title = &#39;Life Sciences is the most common \\neducation field among our active employees.&#39;, x = &#39;Education Field&#39;, y = &#39;Headcount&#39;) + ggplot2::scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;Human Resources&quot; = &quot;#BFBFBF&quot;, &quot;Life Sciences&quot; = &quot;#0070C0&quot;, &quot;Marketing&quot; = &quot;#BFBFBF&quot;, &quot;Medical&quot; = &quot;#BFBFBF&quot;, &quot;Other&quot; = &quot;#BFBFBF&quot;, &quot;Technical Degree&quot; = &quot;#BFBFBF&quot;)) + ggplot2::theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;, panel.background = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0, colour = &quot;#404040&quot;, margin = margin(t = 0, r = 0, b = 10, l = 0)), axis.title.x = element_text(colour = &quot;#404040&quot;, margin = margin(t = 10, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0)), axis.title.y = element_text(colour = &quot;#404040&quot;, margin = margin(t = 0, r = 10, b = 0, l = 0))) # Display distribution visualizations ggpubr::ggarrange(viz_post, viz_pre, ncol = 1, nrow = 2) Figure 15.4: Top: Enhanced design.
