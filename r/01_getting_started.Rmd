# Getting Started {#get-started}

  Nothing in this book will increase the value of an analysis no one needs. Analyses should always have a strong value proposition -- a clear expectation of how an analysis will support a General Manager, People Partner, Salesperson, or other member of the organization. Curiosity is not a business reason, and this chapter will cover a set of guiding principles as well as a project management framework that will help ensure analytics are anchored in well-defined problem statements with meaningful ROI.
  
  In addition, this book will cut through the fluff and teach you how to do stuff that matters. Knowledge of concepts is futile without an understanding of how to apply them to people analytics use cases. Whether you are a people leader, individual contributor, or aspiring analytics practitioner, this book is for you. This book will serve as a guide through the analytics lifecycle, curating the key concepts and applications germane to common questions and hypotheses within people analytics.

## Guiding Principles

  Among the many principles guiding how analytics teams operate, there are three that I have found to be universally applicable and critical to the success of an analytics capability.

### Pro Employee Thinking

  "With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility."

  ‘Pro employee’ thinking is addressed first and for good reason. People analytics has the power to improve the lives of people in meaningful ways. Whether we are shedding light on an area of the business struggling with work-life balance or identifying developmental areas of which a group of leaders may be unaware, people analytics ideally improves employee well-being and effectively, the success of the business. It is important to embrace a ‘pro employee’ philosophy, as newfound knowledge could also have damaging repercussions if shared with the wrong people or if findings are disseminated without proper instruction on how to interpret and act.

  One way to error on the side of caution when considering whether to disseminate insights is to ask the following: “With this knowledge, could the recipient act in a manner that is inconsistent with our ‘pro employee’ philosophy?” If the answer to this question is not a clear “no”, discuss with your HR, legal, and privacy partners and together, determine how best to proceed. The decision may be to not share the findings with the intended audience at all or to develop a proper communication and training plan to ensure there is consistency in how recipients interpret the insights and act in response. Employment Law and Data Privacy Counsel are our friends, and it is important to build strong relationships with these critical partners.

### Quality

  "Garbage In, Garbage Out."

  Never compromise quality for greater velocity. If quality falls to the bottom of the priority list, all other efforts are pointless. It is unlikely that requestors of data and analytics will ever ask us to take longer to prepare the information. The onus is on us as analytics professionals to level set on a reasonable timeline for analyses based on many factors that can materially impact the quality of analyses and insights. A single instance of compromised quality can have lasting damage on the reputation of the analytics function and cause consumers of insights to view all findings as suspect. Be sure quality is consistently a top value and guard your team’s reputation at all costs. If stakeholders lose trust, there will likely be additional data requests for validation; this is wasteful to both you and your user community and detracts from the bigger story that needs to be conveyed.

  To be clear, by ‘quality’ I am referring to results, which is dependent on data integrity in the source systems, proper data preparation steps, and many other factors. Most of the analyst’s time is spent on data preparation (data collection, cleaning and organizing, building training sets, mining for patterns, refining algorithms, etc.). If tight controls do not exist within the source application to support data integrity, data preparation efforts can only go so far in delivering reliable and valid findings. It is often the analysts who identify data integrity issues due to the nature of their work; therefore, close relationships should be formed with source application owners to put into place validation rules to proactively prevent the entry of erroneous data or at the very least, exception/audit reports to identify and address the issues soon after the fact.

### Prioritization
  
  "If everything is a priority, nothing is a priority."
  
  If there is not a supply-demand gap on the analytics team, the team likely isn't asking enough questions. It is okay (even good) to have a backlog of projects if unmet demand largely represents requests for lower-impact analyses. It is crucial to be relentless about prioritizing strategically important projects with 'measurable' impact over merely interesting questions that few care to answer. According to the Pareto Principle, 80% of outcomes (or outputs) result from 20% of causes (or inputs). In analytics, it is important to be laser focused on identifying the 20% of inputs that will result in disproportionate value creation for stakeholders. There are some general customer-oriented questions I have found to be helpful for the intake process to optimize the allocation of time and resources:
  
  1. Does this support a company or departmental objective? If not, why should this be prioritized over something else?
  2. Who is the executive sponsor? Really important projects will have an executive-level sponsor.
  3. What quantitative and/or qualitative data can be provided as a rationale for this request? Is there data to support doing this, or is the problem statement rooted merely in anecdotes?
  4. Will this mitigate risk or enable opportunities?
  5. What actions can or will be taken as a result of this analysis?
  6. What is the *scale* of impact (# of impacted people)?
  7. What is the *depth* of impact (minimum --> significant)?
  8. Is this a dependency or blocker for another important deliverable?
  9. What is the impact of not doing (or delaying) this?
  10. What is the request date? Is there flexibility in this date and/or scope of the request (e.g., what does MVP look like)?
  
  These questions can be weighted and scored as well to support a more automated and data-driven approach to prioritization.
  
## Tools

  This book uses freely available software for statistics, modeling, and data visualization. All code has been written such that it is fully reproducible should you choose to follow along on your machine (and I highly recommend you do).

### R
  
  While there are many commercial-grade analytics toolsets, R is open-sourced statistical and data visualization software that can be downloaded free of charge. It is incredibly powerful, and there is a package (or at least the ability to easily create one) for every conceivable statistical technique and data visualization. It is also widely used in highly regulated environments. As of this writing, R Markdown -- the dynamic document creator in which I am writing this book -- allows for coding in 56 different languages! Therefore, the debate around whether to use Python, Julia, or something else is now moot; we need not sacrifice the advantages of other languages by choosing one. To get started, simply download the latest version of R and the R Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using the following links:

  * R: https://www.r-project.org/
  * R Studio IDE: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
  
  Please note that while R basics are covered, this is not a book on how to code. It is assumed that you already understand programming fundamentals. If this is not the case, an introductory programming course is highly recommended; this is one of the best investments you can make for a successful career in analytics. The ability to write code is now table stakes for anyone in an analytics-oriented field, as this is the best way to develop reproducible analyses. Coding is to analytics professionals what typing was for Baby Boomers decades ago; a lack of coding proficiency is a major limiting factor on one's potential in analytics.
  
  Libraries from several R packages will be utilized in this book. The line of code below can be executed within R to install all at once:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Install required packages
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "corrplot", "psych", "moments", "ggpubr", "GGally"), dependencies = TRUE, repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

```
  
  The goal of the code provided in this book is not to represent the most performant, succinct, or productionalizable approaches. The code herein is intended only to facilitate understanding and demonstrate how concepts can be implemented in people analytics settings. Programming expertise is important for optimizing these approaches for production applications.

## 4D Framework

  In practical analytics settings, we generally operate with respect to five primary constraints: timeliness, client expectation, accuracy, reliability, and cost (Bartlett, 2013). Adherence to a lightweight framework over hastily rushing into an analysis full of assumptions generally lends to better outcomes that respect these constraints. A framework ensures (a) the problem statement is understood and well-defined; (b) relevant literature and prior research are reviewed; (c) the measurement strategy is sound; (d) the analysis approach is suitable for the hypotheses being tested; and (e) results and conclusions are valid and communicated in a way that resonates with the target audience. This chapter will outline a recommended framework as well as other important considerations that should be reviewed early in the project.

  It is important to develop a clear understanding of the key elements of research. Scientific research is the systematic, controlled, empirical, and critical investigation of natural phenomena guided by theory and hypotheses about the presumed relations among such phenomena (Kerlinger & Lee, 2000). In other words, research is an organized and systematic way of finding answers to questions. If you are in the business of analytics, I encourage you to think of yourself as a research scientist -- regardless of whether you are wearing a lab coat or have plans to publish.

  As we will discover when exploring the laws of probability in a later chapter, there is a 1 in 20 chance of finding a significant result when none exists. Therefore, it is important to remain disciplined and methodical to protect against backward research wherein the researcher mines data for interesting relationships or differences and then develops hypotheses which they know the data support. There have been many examples of bad research over the years, which often presents in the form of p-hacking or data dredging: the act of finding data to confirm what the researcher wants to prove. This can occur by running an exhaustive number of experiments to find one that supports the hypothesis, or by using only a subset of data which features the expected patterning.

  Academics at elite research institutions are often under immense pressure to publish in top-tier journals which have a track record of accepting new ground-breaking research over replication studies or unsupported hypotheses, and incentives have unfortunately influenced some to compromise integrity. As my PhD advisor told me many years ago, an unsupported hypothesis -- while initially disappointing given the exhaustive literature review that precedes its development -- is a meaningful empirical contribution given theory suggests the opposite should be true.

  If you participated in a science fair as a child, you are likely already familiar with the scientific method. The scientific method is the standard scheme of organized and systematic inquiry, and this duly applies to people analytics practitioners in the promotion of robust analyses and recommendations.

```{r sci-method, out.width = "75%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'The Scientific Method', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/scientific_method.png")

```

  Over the years, I have adapted the scientific method into a curtailed four-dimensional framework which is intended to elevate the rigor applied to the end-to-end analytical process. The four dimensions are (a) Discover, (b) Design, (c) Develop, and (d) Deliver, and this book will be organized around these. A comprehensive checklist with questions and considerations for each phase of the analytics lifecycle can be found in the Appendix \@ref(fig:4d-chklst).

```{r 4d-framework, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = '4D Framework', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/4d_framework_overview.png")

```

### Discover

  You are likely familiar with the following adage: "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." Such is the case with respect to planning in an analytics context. During the Discover phase, it is important to remain in the problem zone; seek to understand your clients' needs through active listening and questions. This is not the time for solutioning or committing to any specific deliverables or timelines. If the client's needs are ambiguous, proceeding without clarity is unlikely to result in a favorable outcome.
  
  It is generally helpful to think about analytics solutions like a Product Owner thinks about the initial and subsequent releases of a commercial product. A **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** is a version of the solution with the minimum number of features to be useful to early customers who can provide feedback for future enhancements. It is important to clarify that the MVP version of solutions has both a limited number of users and features and that this is antithetical to building solutions that seek to address every imaginable question for every possible user. Breaking down large projects into small sets of features that are easier to communicate and adopt provides space for agility and real-time adjustments to the product roadmap per user feedback.
  
### Design

  Perhaps the most important initial question to answer in the design phase is: "Does anything already exist that addresses part, or all, of the client’s objectives?" If an existing solution will suffice, or a previous analysis can be easily refreshed with recent data, it may be possible to allocate time and resources elsewhere. If related or complimentary analyses have already been performed, they may accelerate new analyses.
  
  The end-user experience is of paramount importance during the Design phase, as solutions should have a consistent look and feel regardless of who developed them. Defining and implementing design guidelines will ensure consistency across analytics projects, as well as within large projects in which multiple analysts are collaborating on various components of the solution.

### Develop

  While development patterns can vary widely across analytics teams, establishing a set of standards can pay dividends in the form of greater efficiency and reliability over time. Pattern-based development ensures analysts who were not involved in a particular project can access the code and easily and quickly understand each step of the analysis: data extraction --> wrangling --> cleaning --> analysis --> visualization.
  
  This is one of the many reasons tools like Excel will not be covered in this book. Software like R and Python allows analysts to organize and annotate steps of the analytical process in a manner that is both logical and reproducible. In case it bears repeating, learning to code is likely the best investment one can make in the pursuit of a career in analytics.

### Deliver

  The Deliver phase can take many forms depending on the solution being released. If the solution is designed for a large user base, a series of recorded trainings may be in order so that there is a helpful reference for those unable to attend the live sessions or new joiners in the future. It is important to monitor success measures, which could be insights aligned to research hypotheses, dashboard utilization metrics, progress following data-informed interventions, or any number of others defined within the Discover phase.
