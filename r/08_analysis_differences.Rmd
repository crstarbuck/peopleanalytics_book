## Practical Significance


### Cohen's d

  **Cohen's d** is a standardized measure of the difference between two means. This statistic can be produced using the `cohen.d()` function from the `effsize` package in R.
  
  $$ d = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2} \frac{s^2_1 + s^2_2}{2} $$
  
  The following thresholds can be referenced as a *general* rule of thumb for interpreting effect size:
  
  * **Small** = 0.2
  * **Medium** = 0.5
  * **Large** = 0.8


### Cliff's Delta

  **Cliff's delta** provides the effect size for ordinal variables. Simply put, Cliff's delta measures how often a value in one distribution is higher than values in another. This statistic can be produced using the `cliff.delta()` function from the `effsize` package in R.
  
  Some (e.g., Vargha & Delaney, 2000) have endeavored to categorize the Cliff's delta statistic, which ranges from -1 to 1, into effect size buckets. However, such categorizations are far more controversial than thresholds attributed to Cohen's d.
