# Supervised Learning Models

It's important to begin this chapter by drawing a distinction between explanatory and predictive models. Explanatory models are highly intrepretable and their utility is largely in understanding the nature and magnitude of the effect variables have on outcomes. Explanatory models also lend to quantifying the extent to which we can generalize the observed effects to the larger population from which the sample was drawn. The objective in predictive modeling is to also to learn from patterns in historical data but for the purpose of achieving the most accurate predictions of future events -- even at the expense of interpretability. To be clear, this isn't to say that predictive models cannot be intrepreted -- they certainly can -- but I've seen relatively few applications for predictive modeling in people analytics because models generally need to be highly interpretable to support action planning. Therefore, the majority of this chapter will be devoted to explanatory models to support a working understanding of how to interpret model output and communicate clear, data-driven narratives that respect the nuance and noise characteristic of people data.
