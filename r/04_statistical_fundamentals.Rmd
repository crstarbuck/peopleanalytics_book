# Statistical Fundamentals

This chapter reviews essential univariate, bivariate, and inferential analysis concepts that underpin the more complex multivariate approaches in subsequent chapters of this book.

## Univariate Analysis

**Descriptive statistics** are rudimentary analysis techniques that help describe and summarize data in a meaningful way. Descriptive statistics do not allow us to draw any conclusions beyond the available data but are helpful in interpreting the data at hand.

There are two categories of descriptive statistics: (a) **measures of central tendency** describe the central position in a set of data; and (b) **measures of spread** describe how dispersed the data are.

### Measures of Central Tendency

  **Mean**
  
  Perhaps the most intuitive measure of central tendency is the **mean**, which is often referred to as the average. The mean of a sample is denoted by $\bar{x}$ and is defined by:
  
  $$ \bar{X} = \frac{\sum x_{i}}{n} $$

The mean of a set of numeric values can be calculated using the mean() function in R:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Fill vector x with integers
x <- c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,50)

# Calculate average of vector x
mean(x)

```

  **Median**
  
  The **median** represents the midpoint in a sorted vector of numbers. For vectors with an even number of values, the median is the average of the middle two numbers; it is simply the middle number for vectors with an odd number of values. When the distribution of data is skewed, or there is an extreme value like we observe in vector x, the median is a better measure of central tendency. 
  
  The median() function in R can be used to handle the sorting and midpoint selection:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate median of vector x
median(x)

```
  
  In this example, the median is only 2 while the mean is 6.9 (which is not really representative of any of the values in vector $x$). Large deltas between mean and median values are evidence of outliers.
  
  **Mode**
  
  The **mode** is the most frequent number in a set of values.
  
  While mean() and median() are standard functions in R, mode() returns the internal storage mode of the object rather than the statistical mode of the data. We can easily create a function to return the statistical mode(s):
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Create function to calculate statistical mode(s)
stat.mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  tab <- tabulate(match(x, ux))
  ux[tab == max(tab)]
}

# Return mode(s) of vector x
stat.mode(x)

```
  
  In this case, we have a bimodal distribution since both 1 and 2 occur most frequently.
  
  **Range**
  
  The **range** is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a set of numbers. 
  
  The range() function in R returns the minimum and maximum numbers:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return lowest and highest values of vector x
range(x)

```

We can leverage the max() and min() functions to calculate the difference between these values:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate range of vector x
max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)

```

In people analytics, there are many conventional descriptive metrics -- largely counts, percentages, and ratios cut by time series (day, month, quarter, year) and categorical dimensions (department, job, location, tenure band). Here is a sample of common measures:

  * Time to Fill: average days between job requisition posting and offer acceptance
  * Offer Acceptance Rate: percent of offers extended to candidates that are accepted
  * Pass-Through Rate: percent of candidates in a particular stage of the recruiting process who passed through to the next stage
  * Progress to Goal: percent of approved positions that have been filled
  * cNPS/eNPS: candidate and employee NPS (-100 to 100)
  * Headcount: counts and percent of workforce across worker types (employee, intern, contingent)
  * Diversity: counts and percent of workforce across gender, ethnicity, and generational cohorts
  * Positions: count and percent of open, committed, and filled seats
  * Hires: counts and rates
  * Career Moves: counts and rates
  * Turnover: counts and rates (usually terms / average headcount over the period)
  * Workforce Growth: net changes over time, accounting for hires, internal transfers, and exits
  * Span of Control: ratio of people leaders to individual contributors
  * Layers/Tiers: average and median number of layers removed from CEO
  * Engagement: average score or top-box favorability score

### Measures of Spread

  **Variance**
  
  **Variance** is a measure of variability in the data. Variance is calculated using the average of squared differences -- or deviations -- from the mean.
  
  Variance of a population is defined by:
  
  $$ \sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum (X_{i}-\mu)^{2}}{N} $$
  
  Variance of a sample is defined by:
  
  $$ s^{2} = \frac{\sum (x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1} $$
  
  It is important to note that since differences are squared, the variance is always non-negative. In addition, we cannot compare these squared differences to the arithmetic mean since the units are different. For example, if we calculate the variance of annual compensation measured in USD, variance should be expressed as USD squared while the mean exists in the original USD unit of measurement.
 
 In R, the sample variance can be calculated using the var() function:
 
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Load library for data wrangling
library(dplyr)

# Read employee demographics data
demographics <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crstarbuck/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/master/data/files/employee_demographics.csv")

# Calculate sample variance for annual compensation
var(demographics$annual_comp)

```

  Sample statistics are the default in R. Since the population variance differs from the sample variance by a factor of `var(x) * (n - 1) / n`, it is simple to convert output from var() to the population variance:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Store number of observations
n = nrow(demographics)

# Calculate population variance for annual compensation
var(demographics$annual_comp) * (n - 1) / n

```

  **Standard Deviation**
  
  The **standard deviation** is simply the square root of the variance, as defined by:
  
  $$ s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}}{N - 1}} $$
  
  Since a squared value can be converted back to its original units by taking its square root, the standard deviation expresses variability around the mean in the variable's original units.
  
   In R, the sample standard deviation can be calculated using the sd() function:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate sample standard deviation for annual compensation
sd(demographics$annual_comp)

```

  Since the population standard deviation differs from the sample standard deviation by a factor of `sd(x) * sqrt((n - 1) / n)`, it is simple to convert output from sd() to the population standard deviation:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate population standard deviation for annual compensation
sd(demographics$annual_comp) * sqrt((n - 1) / n)

```

  **Quartiles**
  
  **Quartiles** are a staple of exploratory data analysis (EDA). A quartile is a type of quantile that partitions data into four equally sized parts after ordering the data. Note that each partition is equally sized with respect to the number of data points -- not the range of values in each. Quartiles are also related to **percentiles**. For example, Q1 is the 25th percentile -- the value at or below which 25% of values lie. Percentiles are likely more familiar than quartiles, as percentiles show up in the height and weight measurements of babies, performance on standardized tests like the SAT and GRE, among other things.
  
  The **Interquartile Range (IQR)** represents the difference between Q3 and Q1 cut point values (the middle two quartiles). The IQR is sometimes used to detect extreme values in a distribution; values less than $Q1 - 1.5 * IQR$ or greater than $Q3 + 1.5 * IQR$ are generally considered outliers.
  
  In R, the quantile() function returns the values that bookend each quartile:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return quartiles for annual compensation
quantile(demographics$annual_comp)

```

  Based on this output, we know that 25% of people in our data earn annual compensation of 87,946 USD or less, 125,522 USD is the median annual compensation, and 75% of people earn annual compensation of 163,263 USD or less.
  
  We can also return a specific percentile value using the `probs` argument in the quantile() function. For example, if we want to know the 80th percentile annual compensation value, we can execute the following:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return 80th percentile annual compensation value
quantile(demographics$annual_comp, probs = .8)

```

  In addition, the summary() function returns several common descriptive statistics for an object:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return common descriptives
summary(demographics$annual_comp)

```

  **Skewness**
  
  **Skewness** is a measure of the horizontal distance between the mode and mean -- a representation of symmetric distortion. In most practical settings, data are not normally distributed. That is, the data are skewed either positively (right-tailed distribution) or negatively (left-tailed distribution). The coefficient of skewness is one of many ways in which we can asertain the degree of skew in the data. The skewness of sample data is defined as:
  
  $$ Sk = \frac{1}{n} \frac{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^3}{s^3} $$

  A positive skewness coefficient indicates positive skew, while a negative coefficient indicates negative skew. The order of descriptive statistics can also be leveraged to ascertain the direction of skew in the data:
  
  * Positive skewness: mode < median < mean
  * Negative skewness: mode > median > mean
  * Symmetrical distribution: mode = median = mean
  
  Figure \@ref(fig:skewness) illustrates the placement of these descriptive statistics in each of the three types of distributions:
  
<br />

```{r skewness, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Skewness', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/skewness.png")

```

<br />

  The magnitude of skewness can be determined by measuring the distance between the mode and mean relative to the variable's scale. Alternatively, we can simply evaluate this using the coefficient of skewness:
  
  * If skewness is between -0.5 - 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical.
  * If skewness is between -0.5 and -1 or 0.5 and 1, the data are moderately skewed.
  * If skewness is < -1 or > 1, the data are highly skewed.
  
  Since there is not a base R function for skewness, we can leverage the moments library to calculate skewness:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Load library
library(moments)

# Calculate skewness for org tenure, rounded to three significant figures
round(skewness(demographics$org_tenure), 3)

```

  **Statistical Moments**, after which this library was named, play an important role in specifying the appropriate probability distribution for a set of data. Moments are a set of statistical parameters used to describe the characteristics of a distribution. Skewness is the third statistical moment in the set; hence the sum of cubed differences and cubic polynomial in the denominator of the formula above. The complete set of moments comprises: (1) expected value or mean, (2) variance and standard deviation, (3) skewness, and (4) kurtosis.

  We can verify that the skewness() function from the moments library returns the expected value (per the aforementioned formula) by validating against a manual calculation:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Store components of skewness calculation
x = demographics$org_tenure
x_bar = mean(demographics$org_tenure)
s = sd(demographics$org_tenure)

# Calculate skewness manually, rounded to three significant figures
round(1/n * (sum((x - x_bar)^3) / s^3), 3)

```

  A skewness coefficient of .562 indicates that organization tenure is moderately and positively skewed. We can visualize the data to confirm the expected right-tailed distribution:

```{r org-tenure-distribution, fig.cap = "Organization Tenure Distribution", fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE}

# Load library for data viz
library(ggplot2)

# Produce histogram to visualize sample distribution
ggplot() + 
  aes(demographics$org_tenure) + 
  labs(x = "Organization Tenure", y = "n") + 
  geom_histogram(colour = "white", size = .1, fill = "#262626")

```

  **Kurtosis**
  
  While skewness provides information on the symmetry of a distribution, **kurtosis** provides information on the heaviness of a distribution's tails ("tailedness"). Kurtosis is the fourth statistical moment, defined by:
  
  $$ K = \frac{1}{n} \frac{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^4}{s^4} $$

  Note that the quartic functions characteristic of the fourth statistical moment are the only differences from the skewness formula we reviewed in the prior section (which featured cubic functions).
  
  The terms **leptokurtic** and **platykurtic** are often used to describe distributions with light and heavy tails, respectively. "Platy-" in platykurtic is the same root as "platypus", and I've found it helpful to recall the characteristics of the flat platypus when characterizing frequency distributions as platkurtic (wide and flat) vs. its antithesis, leptokurtic (tall and skinny). The normal (or Gaussian) distribution is referred to as a **mesokurtic** distribution in the context of kurtosis.
  
  Figure \@ref(fig:kurtosis) illustrates the three kurtosis categorizations:

```{r kurtosis, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Kurtosis', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/kurtosis.jpg")

```

  Kurtosis is measured relative to a normal distribution. Normal distributions have a kurtosis coefficient of 3. Therefore, the kurtosis coefficient is greater than 3 for leptokurtic distributions and less than 3 for platykurtic distributions.

  The moments library can also be used to calculate kurtosis in R:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate kurtosis for org tenure, rounded to two significant figures
round(kurtosis(demographics$org_tenure), 2)

```

  We can verify that the kurtosis() function returns the expected value (per the aforementioned formula) by validating against a manual calculation:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate kurtosis manually, rounded to two significant figures
round(1/n * (sum((x - x_bar)^4) / s^4), 2)

```

  As we saw in Figure \@ref(fig:org-tenure-distribution), there is a long right tail about the organization tenure distribution. However, due to the moderate skew, there is no left tail. Therefore, our kurtosis coefficient is < 3 since the presence of the right tail is offset by the lack of a left tail. This is why it is important not to characterize a distribution based on a single isolated metric; we need the complete set of statistical moments to fully understand the distribution of data.
  
### Bivariate Analysis  

  **Covariance**
  
  While variance provides an understanding of how values for a single variable vary, **covariance** is an unstandardized measure of how two variables vary together. Values can range from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, and these values can be used to understand the direction of the linear relationship between variables. Positive covariance values indicate that the variables vary in the same direction (e.g., tend to increase or decrease together), while negative covariance values indicate that the variables vary in opposite directions (e.g., when one increases, the other decreases, or vice versa).
  
  Covariance of a sample is defined by:

$$ cov_{x,y} = \frac{\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})}{N-1} $$

  It's important to note that while covariance aids our understanding of the direction of the relationship between two variables, we cannot use it to understand the strength of the association since it is unstandardized. Due to differences in variables' units of measurement, the strength of the relationship between two variables with large covariance could be weak, while the strength of the relationship between another pair of variables with small covariance could be strong. 
  
  In R, we can compute the covariance between a pair of numeric variables by passing the two vectors into the cov() function:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate sample covariance between annual compensation and age using complete observations (missing values will cause issues if not addressed)
cov(demographics$annual_comp, demographics$age, use = "complete.obs")

```
  
  In this example, using the default Pearson method, the covariance between annual compensation and age is 453179.1. The positive value indicates that annual compensation is generally higher for older employees and lower for younger employees.
  
  Just as we multiplied the sample variance by $(n - 1) / n$ to obtain the population variance, we can apply the same approach to convert the sample covariance returned by cov() to the population covariance:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate population covariance between annual compensation and age
cov(demographics$annual_comp, demographics$age, use = "complete.obs") * (n - 1) / n

```

  The examples thus far have only examined associations between two variables at a time. However, rather than looking at isolated pairwise relationships, we can produce a covariance matrix to surface associations among many variables by passing a dataframe or matrix object into the cov() function:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Generate a correlation matrix among continuous variables
cov(demographics[, c("annual_comp", "age", "org_tenure", "job_tenure")], use = "complete.obs")

```

  Using the default Pearson method, the cov() function will return sample variances for each variable down the diagonal, since covariance is not applicable in the context of a variable with itself. We can confirm by producing the variance for age:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return sample variance for age
var(demographics$age)

```

  As expected, the variance for age ($s^{2}$ = 168.39) matches the value found in the age x age cell of the covariance matrix.

  **Correlation**

  **Correlation** is a scaled form of covariance. While covariance provides an unstandardized measure of the direction of a relationship between variables, correlation provides a standardized measure that can be used to quantify both the direction and strength of bivariate relationships. Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfectly negative association, 1 indicates a perfectly positive association, and 0 indicates the absence of an association. **Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient** $r$ is defined by:

$$ r_{x,y} = \frac{\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_(x_{i}-\bar{x})^2\sum_(y_{i}-\bar{y})^2}} $$

  In R, Pearson's $r$ can be calculated using the cor() function:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate the correlation between annual compensation and age
cor(demographics$annual_comp, demographics$age, use = "complete.obs")

```

  While we already know that the relationship between annual compensation and age is positive based on the positive covariance coefficient, Pearson's $r$ of .81 indicates that the strength of the positive association is strong ($r$ = 1 is perfectly positive). Though there are no absolute rules for categorizing the strength of relationships, as thresholds often vary by domain, the following is a general rule of thumb for interpreting the strength of bivariate associations:
  
  * Weak = Absolute value of correlation coefficients between 0 and .3
  * Moderate = Absolute value of correlation coefficients between .4 and .6
  * Strong = Absolute value of correlation coefficients between .7 and 1
  
  There are several correlation coefficients, and the measurement scale of $x$ and $y$ determine the appropriate type:
  
<br />

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Proper Applications of Correlation Coefficients', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/correlation_table.png")

```

<br />
  
  Pearson's $r$ can be used when both variables are measured on continuous scales or when one is continuous and the other is dichotomous (point-biserial correlation).
  
  When one or both variables are ordinal, we can leverage **Spearman's** $\rho$ or **Kendall's** $\tau$, which are both standardized nonparametric measures of the association between one or two rank-ordered variables. Let's look at Spearman's $\rho$, which is defined as:
  
  $$ \rho = 1 - {\frac {6 \sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}} $$
  
  We can override the default Pearson method in the cor() function to implement a specific form of rank correlation using the `method` argument:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate the correlation between job level and education level using Spearman's method
cor(demographics$job_level, demographics$education, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")

```

  The $\rho$ coefficient of .67 indicates that the positive association we observed between job level and education level is moderate-to-strong. We could also pass `method = "kendall"` to this cor() function to implement Kendall's $\tau$.
  
  The **Phi Coefficient** ($\phi$), sometimes referred to as the mean square contingency coefficient or Matthews correlation in ML, can be used to understand the association between two dichotomous variables. For a 2x2 table for two random variables $x$ and $y$:
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = '2x2 Table for Random Variables x and y', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/phi_coefficient_formula.png")

```

  The $\phi$ coefficient is defined as:
  
  $$ \phi = {\frac {(AD-BC)}{\sqrt{(A+B)(C+D)(A+C)(B+D)}}} $$
  
  To illustrate, let's examine whether there is a relationship between gender and performance after transforming performance from its ordinal form to a dichotomous variable (high vs. low performance). We can leverage the `psych` library to calculate $\phi$ in R:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Load library for Phi Coefficient
library(psych)

# Set females to 1 and everything else to 0
demographics$gender_code <- ifelse(demographics$gender == 'Female', 1, 0)

# Set high performers (3 and above) to 1 and everything else to 0
demographics$performance_code <- ifelse(demographics$performance < 3, 0, 1)

# Create a 2x2 contingency table
contingency_tbl <- table(demographics$gender_code, demographics$performance_code)

# Calculate the Phi Coefficient between dichotomous variables
phi(contingency_tbl)

``` 
  
  $\phi$ is essentially 0, which means performance ratings are distributed equitably across gender categories (good news!).
  
  A correlation matrix can be produced to surface associations among many variables by passing a dataframe or matrix object into the cor() function:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Generate a correlation matrix among continuous variables
cor(demographics[, c("annual_comp", "age", "org_tenure", "job_tenure")], use = "complete.obs")

```

  Based on this correlation matrix, there are several moderate and strong pairwise associations in the data. The values down the diagonal are 1 because these represent the correlation between each variable and itself. You may also notice that the information above and below the diagonal is identical and, therefore, redundant.
  
  A great R library for visualizing correlation matrices is corrplot. Several arguments can be specified for various visual representations of the relationships among variables:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Load library for correlation visuals
library(corrplot)

# Store correlation matrix to object M
M <- cor(demographics[, c("annual_comp", "age", "org_tenure", "job_tenure")], method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")

# Visualize correlation matrix
corrplot.mixed(M, order = 'AOE')

```

  It's important to remember that correlation is not causation. Correlations can be spurious (variables related by chance), and drawing conclusions based on bivariate associations alone -- especially in the absence of sound theoretical underpinnings -- can be dangerous. Here are two examples of nearly perfect correlations between variables for which there is likely no true direct association:
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Correlation between Maine Divorce Rate and Margarine Consumption (r = .99)', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/spurious_corr_maine_divorce.png")

```
  
<br />
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Correlation between Mozzarella Cheese Consumption and Civil Engineering Doctorate Conferrals (r = .96)', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/spurious_corr_mozzarella_cheese.png")

```

  In addition, covariance and correlation alone are not sufficient for determining whether an observed association in sample data is also present in the population. To understand the likelihood that patterns observed in sample data are also present in the larger population of interest, we need to move beyond descriptive measures.

## Inferential Statistics

  The objective of **inferential statistics** is to make inferences -- with some degree of confidence -- about a population based on available sample data. Several related concepts underpin this goal and will be covered here.

### Introduction to Probability

  **Randomness** and uncertainty exist all around us. In **probability theory**, random phenomena refers to events or experiments whose outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty (Pishro-Nik, 2014). If you've taken a course in probability, there is a good chance you have considered the case of a fair coin flip -- one of the most intuitive applications of probability. In the absence of information on how the coin is flipped, we cannot be certain of the outcome. What we can be certain of is that with a large number of coin flips, the proportion of heads will become increasingly close to 50%, or $\frac{1}{2}$. 

  The **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)** is an important theorem for building an intuitive understanding of how probability relates to the statistical inference concepts we will cover. In the case of a fair coin flip, it is possible to observe many consecutive heads by chance. This is because small samples can lend to anamalies. However, as the number of flips increases, we will undoubtedly observe an increasing number of tails; we expect a roughly equal number of heads and tails with a large enough number of flips.

  **Conditional probability** reflects the probability conditioned on the occurrence of a previous event or outcome. For example, we may find that the proportion of heads is greater or less than $\frac{1}{2}$ with a large number of fair coin flips when the coin is consistently heads up when flipped. The outcome is, therefore, conditioned on the fixed -- rather than random -- positioning of the coin when flipped.

  Formally, **Bayes' Theorem (alternatively, Bayes' Rule)** states that for any two events A and B where the probability of A is not 0 ($P(A) \neq 0$):

  $$ P(B \vert A) = \frac{P(A \vert B) P(B)}{P(A)} $$

  Bayes' Rule allows us to more accurately predict the outcome by conditioning the probability on known factors rather than assuming all events operate under the same conditions. Bayes' Rule is pervasive in people analytics, as the probability of outcomes can vary widely based on a person's age, tenure, education, job, perceptions, relationships, and many other factors. For example, if we consider a company with 100 terminations over a 12-month period and average headcount of 1,000, the probability of attrition not conditioned on any other factor is 10%, or $\frac{1}{10}$. Aside from trending this probability over time to identify if attrition is becoming more or less of a concern, this isn't too helpful at the broader company level. However, if we condition the probability of attrition on an event -- such as a recent manager exit -- and find that the probability of attrition among those whose manager has left in the last six months is 70%, or $\frac{7}{10}$, this is far more actionable (and concerning).

### Central Limit Theorem

  The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is a mainstay of statistics and probability and fundamental to understanding the mechanics of multivariate inferential analysis techniques we will cover later in this book. The CLT was initially coined by a French-born mathematician named Abraham De Moivre in the 1700s. While initially unpopular, it was later reintroduced and attracted new interest from theorists and academics (Daw & Pearson, 1972). 

  The CLT states that the average of independent random variables, when increased in number, tend to follow a normal (or Gaussian) distribution. The distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution regardless of the shape of the population distribution from which the samples are drawn. This is important because the normal distribution has properties that can be used to test the likelihood that an observed value, difference, or relationship in a sample is also present in the population.

<br />

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'The Empirical Rule', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/normal_distribution.png")

```

<br />

  Let's begin with an intuitive example of CLT. Imagine that we have a reliable way to measure how fun a population is on a 100-point scale, where 100 indicates maximum fun (life of the party) and 1 indicates maximum boringness. Consider that a small statistics conference is in progress at a nearby convention center, and there are 40 statisticians in attendance. In a separate room at the same convention center, there is also a group of 40 random people (non-statisticians) who are gathered to discuss some less interesting topic. Our job is to walk into one of the rooms and determine -- on the basis of the "fun" factor alone -- whether we have entered the statistics conference or the other, less interesting gathering of non-statisticians.

  Let's assume the mean fun score and standard deviation of these two groups are known; the group of statisticians have, on average, a fun score of 85 with a standard deviation of 2, while the group of non-statisticians are a bit less fun with a mean score of 65 and a standard deviation of 4. With a known population mean and standard deviation, the standard error (the standard deviation of the sample means) provides the ability to calculate the probability that the sample (the room of 40 people) belongs to the population of interest (fellow statisticians).

  Herein lies the beauty of the CLT: roughly 68 percent of sample means will lie within one standard error of the population mean, roughly 95 percent within two standard errors of the population mean, and roughly 99 percent within three standard errors of the population mean. Therefore, any room whose members have an average fun score that is not within two standard errors of the population mean (between 81 and 89 for our statisticians) is statistically unlikely to be the group of statisticians for which we are searching. This is because in less than 5 in 100 cases could we randomly draw a 'reasonably sized' sample of statisticians with average funness so extremely different from the population average. 

  Because small samples lend to anomalies, we could -- by chance -- select a single person who happens to fall in the tails (extremely boring or extremely fun); however, as the sample size increases, it becomes more and more likely that the observed average reflects the average of the larger population. It would be virtually impossible (in less than 1 in 100 cases) to draw a random sample of statisticians from the population with average funness that is not within three standard errors of the population mean (between 79 and 91). Therefore, if we find that the room of people have an average fun score of 75, we will likely have far more fun in the other room!

  Let's now see the CLT in action by simulating a random uniform population distribution from which we can draw random samples. Remember, the shape of the population distribution does not matter; we could simulate an Exponential, Gamma, Poisson, Binomial, or other distribution and observe the same behavior.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Set seed for reproducible random distribution
set.seed(1234)

# Generate uniform population distribution with 1000 values ranging from 1 to 100
rand.unif <- runif(1000, min = 1, max = 100)

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate population mean
mean(rand.unif)

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate population variance
var(rand.unif) * (n - 1) / n

```

```{r, fig.cap = "Uniform Population Distribution (N = 1000)", fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE}

# Produce histogram to visualize population distribution
ggplot() + 
  aes(rand.unif) + 
  labs(x = "x", y = "N") + 
  geom_histogram(colour = "white", size = .1, fill = "#262626")

```

  As expected, these randomly generated data are uniformly distributed. Next, we will draw 100 random samples of various sizes and plot the average of each.

```{r, fig.cap = "Distribution of 100 Sample Means of Varied Size", fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE}

# Define number of samples to draw from population distribution
samples <- 100

# Populate vector with sample sizes
sample_n <- c(1:5,10,25,50)

# Initialize empty data frame to hold sample means
sample_means = NULL

# Set seed for reproducible random samples
set.seed(456)

# For each n, draw random samples
for (n in sample_n) {
  
  for (draw in 1:samples) {
    
      # Store sample means in data frame
      sample_means <- rbind(sample_means, cbind.data.frame(
                            n = n, 
                            x_bar = mean(sample(rand.unif, n, replace = TRUE, prob = NULL))))
  }
}

# Produce histograms to visualize distributions of sample means, grouped by n-count
sample_means %>% ggplot() + 
  aes(x = x_bar, fill = n) + 
  labs(x = "x-bar", y = "n") + 
  geom_histogram(colour = "white", size = .1, fill = "#262626") + 
  facet_wrap(~n)

```

  Per the CLT, we can see that as n increases, the sample means become more normally distributed.

### Confidence Intervals

  A **Confidence Interval (CI)** represents a range of values likely to include a population parameter of interest (usually $\mu$). A related concept that is fundamental to estimating CIs is the **standard error (SE)**, which is the standard deviation of sample means. While the standard deviation is a measure of variability for random variables, the variability captured by the SE reflects how representative the sample is of the population. Since sample statistics will approach the actual population parameters as the size of the sample increases, the SE and sample size are inversely related; that is, the SE decreases as the sample size increases. The SE is defined by:
  
  $$ SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$
  
  Next, let's validate that our simulated distribution of sample means adheres to the properties of normally distributed data per the Empirical Rule:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Store sample means with n = 50
x_bars <- sample_means[sample_means$n == 50, "x_bar"]

# Store sample size
n <- length(x_bars)

# Calculate percent of sample means within +/- 2 SEs
length(x_bars[x_bars < mean(x_bars) + 2 * sd(x_bars) & x_bars > mean(x_bars) - 2 * sd(x_bars)]) / n * 100

```

  97% of sample means are within 2 SEs, which is roughly what we expect per the characteristics of the normal distribution. 
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate percent of sample means within +/- 3 SEs
length(x_bars[x_bars < mean(x_bars) + 3 * sd(x_bars) & x_bars > mean(x_bars) - 3 * sd(x_bars)]) / n * 100

```

  All of the sample means are within 3 SEs, indicating that it would be highly unlikely -- nearly impossible even -- to observe a sample mean 'from the same population' that falls outside this interval.
  
  Now, let's illustrate the relationship between CIs and standard errors using sample data from our uniform population distribution. In our example, both $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are known and our sample size $n$ is at least 30; therefore, we can use a **Z-Test** to calculate the 95% CI. A $z$ score of 1.96 corresponds to the 95% CI -- the range of values we would expect to include $\mu$ in at least 95 of 100 random samples taken from the population:

  The CI in this case is defined by:
  
  $$ CI = \bar{X} \pm z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$
  
  Let's randomly take $n$ = 100 from the population, and compute sample statistics to estimate the 95% CI:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Set seed for reproducible random samples
set.seed(456)

# Sample 100 values from uniform population distribution
x <- sample(rand.unif, 100, replace = TRUE, prob = NULL)

# Calculate 95% CI
ci95_lower_bound <- mean(x) - 1.96 * (sd(x) / sqrt(100))
ci95_upper_bound <- mean(x) + 1.96 * (sd(x) / sqrt(100))

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print lower bound for 95% CI
ci95_lower_bound

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print upper bound for 95% CI
ci95_upper_bound

```

  Our known $\mu$ is 51.2, which is covered by our 95% CI (47.9 - 59.0). Per the CLT, in less than 5% of cases would we expect to draw a random sample from the population that results in a 95% CI which does not include $\mu$. Note that our CI narrows with larger samples since our confidence that the range includes $\mu$ increases with more data.
  
  Next, let's look at a 99% CI. We will enter 2.576 for $z$:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate 99% CI
ci99_lower_bound <- mean(x) - 2.576 * (sd(x) / sqrt(100))
ci99_upper_bound <- mean(x) + 2.576 * (sd(x) / sqrt(100))

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print lower bound for 99% CI
ci99_lower_bound

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print upper bound for 99% CI
ci99_upper_bound

```
  
  Like the 95% CI, this slightly wider 99% CI (46.2 - 60.7) also includes our $\mu$ of 51.2.
  
  If $\sigma$ is not known, and/or we have a small sample ($n$ < 30), we need to use a **T-Test** to calculate the CIs. In a people analytics setting, the reality is that population parameters are often unknown. For example, if we knew how engagement scores vary in the employee population, there would be no need to survey a sample of employees and make inferences about said population.
  
  As we will see, the T-Test underpins many statistical tests and models germane to the people analytics discipline since we are often working with small datasets, so it is important to understand the mechanics. The $t$ distribution is wider and shorter relative to the normal distribution, and this is characteristic of the distribution of sample means for smaller samples we observed in our CLT example. As a result, we must apply a different factor to estimate the CI to reflect the more **platykurtic** distribution. The CI in this case is defined by:
  
  $$ CI = \bar{X} \pm t \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$
  
  Let's compare CIs calculated using a T-Test to those calculated using the Z-Test. While a fixed $z$ score can be used for each CI level when $n$ > 30, the $t$ statistic varies based on both the CI level and **degrees of freedom (df)** ($n$ - 1). We can reference the following table to obtain the $t$ statistic for each CI level:
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = paste("Critical Values of Student's t Distribution"), fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/t-table.png")

```

  For illustrative purposes, let's draw a smaller sample of $n$ = 25 from our uniform population distribution and calculate the 95% CI using the $t$ statistic from the table ($df$ = 24):

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Set seed for reproducible random samples
set.seed(456)

# Sample 25 values from uniform population distribution
x <- sample(rand.unif, 25, replace = TRUE, prob = NULL)

# Calculate 95% CI
ci95_lower_bound <- mean(x) - 2.064 * (sd(x) / sqrt(25))
ci95_upper_bound <- mean(x) + 2.064 * (sd(x) / sqrt(25))

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print lower bound for 95% CI
ci95_lower_bound

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print upper bound for 95% CI
ci95_upper_bound

```

  As expected, the 95% CI using the $t$ statistic is much wider (35.2 - 59.6), acknowledging the increased uncertainty in estimating population parameters given this smaller sample. To increase our confidence to the 99% level, the interval widens even further (30.9 - 63.9):

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate 99% CI
ci99_lower_bound <- mean(x) - 2.797 * (sd(x) / sqrt(25))
ci99_upper_bound <- mean(x) + 2.797 * (sd(x) / sqrt(25))

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print lower bound for 99% CI
ci99_lower_bound

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print upper bound for 99% CI
ci99_upper_bound

```

  **Hypothesis Testing**

**Hypothesis testing** is how we leverage CIs to test whether a significant difference or relationship exists in the data. Sir Ronald Fisher invented what is known as the null hypothesis, which states that there is no relationship/difference; disprove me if you can! The null hypothesis is defined by:

$$ H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B $$

  The objective of hypothesis testing is to determine if there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis always states that there is 'nothing' of significance. For example, if we want to test whether an intervention has an effect on an outcome in a population, the null hypothesis states that there is no effect. If we want to test whether there is a difference in average scores between two groups in a population, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference.

  An alternative hypothesis may simply state that there is a difference or relationship in the population, or it may specify the expected direction (e.g., Population A has a significantly 'larger' or 'smaller' average value than Population B; Variable A is 'positively' or 'negatively' related to Variable B). Therefore, alternative hypotheses are defined by:

$$ H_A: \mu_A \neq \mu_B $$

$$ H_A: \mu_A < \mu_B $$

$$ H_A: \mu_A > \mu_B $$

  **Alpha**

  The **alpha** level of a hypothesis test, denoted by $\alpha$, represents the probability of obtaining observed results due to chance if the null hypothesis is true. In other words, $\alpha$ is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (and therefore claiming that there is a significant difference or relationship) when in fact we should have failed to reject it because there is insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
  
  $\alpha$ is often set at .05 but is sometimes set at a more rigorous .01, depending upon the context and tolerance for error. An $\alpha$ of .05 corresponds to a 95% CI (1 - .05), and .01 to a 99% CI (1 - .01). With non-directional alternative hypotheses, we must divide $\alpha$ by 2 (i.e., we could observe a significant result in either tail of the distribution), while one-tailed tests position the rejection region entirely within one tail based on what is being hypothesized. 
  
  At the .05 level, we would conclude that a finding is statistically significant if the chance of observing a value at least as extreme as the one observed is less than 1 in 20 if the null hypothesis is true. Note that we observed this behavior with our simulated distribution of sample means. While we could observe more extreme values by chance with repeated attempts, in less than 1 in every 20 times would we expect a 95% CI that does not capture $\mu$. Moreover, in less than 1 in every 100 times should we expect a sample with a 99% CI that does not capture $\mu$.

  **Beta**
  
  Another key value is **Beta**, denoted by $\beta$, which relates to the power of the analysis. Simply put, power reflects our ability to find a difference or relationship if there is one. Power is calculated by 1 - $\beta$. At this point, it should be intuitive that larger samples increase our chances of observing significant results. As we observed in the T-Test example, CIs for small samples ($n$ < 30) are quite wide relative to those for large samples; therefore, the power of the analysis to detect significance is limited given how extremely different values of $x$ must be to observe non-overlapping CIs.
  
  **Type I & II Errors**

  A **Type I Error** is a false positive, wherein we conclude that there is a significant difference or relationship when there is not. A **Type II Error** is a false negative, wherein we fail to capture a significant finding. $\alpha$ represents our chance of making a Type I Error, while $\beta$ represents our chance of making a Type II Error. I once had a professor explain that committing a Type I error is a shame, while committing a Type II error is a pity, and I've found this to be a helpful way to remember what each type of error represents.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Type I and II Errors', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/hypothesis_testing_errors.png")

```

  **P-Values**
  
  In statistical tests, the **p-value** is referenced to determine whether the null hypothesis can be rejected. The p-value represents the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one observed if the null hypothesis is true. As a general rule, if $p$ < .05, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the observed difference or relationship was unlikely a chance observation.

  While statistical significance helps us understand the probability of observing results by chance when there is actually no difference or effect in the population, it does not tell us anything about the size of the difference or effect. Analysis should never be reduced to inspecting p-values; in fact, p-values have been the subject of much controversy among researchers and practitioners in recent years. Later chapters will cover how to interpret results of statistical tests to surface the story and determine if there is anything 'practically' significant among statistically significant findings.
  
  **Bonferroni Correction**
  
  One caveat when leveraging a p-value to determine statistical significance is that when multiple testing is performed -- that is, multiple tests using the same sample data -- the probability of a Type I error increases by a factor equivalent to the number of tests performed. It's important to note that there is not agreement among statisticians about how (or even whether) the p-value threshold for statistical significance needs to be adjusted to account for this increased risk. Nevertheless, we will cover this conservative approach for mitigating this risk.
  
  Thus far, we have only discussed statistical significance in the context of a **per analysis error rate** -- that is, the probability of committing a Type I error for a single statistical test. However, when two or more tests are being conducted on the same sample, the **familywise error rate** is an important factor in determining statistical significance. The familywise error rate reflects the fact that as we conduct more and more analyses on the same sample, the probability of a Type I error across the set (or family) of analyses increases. The familywise error rate can be calculated by:
  
  $$ \alpha_{FW} = 1 - (1 - \alpha_{PC})^C,  $$

  where $c$ is equal to the number of comparisons (or statistical tests) performed, and $\alpha_{PC}$ is equal to the specified per analysis error rate (usually .05). For example, if $\alpha$ = .05 per analysis, the probability of a Type I error with three tests on the same data increases from 5% to 14.3%: $1 - (1 - .05)^3 = .143$.
  
  The most common method of adjusting the familywise error rate down to the specified per analysis error rate is the **Bonferroni Correction**. To implement this correction, we can simply divide $\alpha$ by the number of analyses performed on the dataset -- such as $\alpha / 3 = .017$ in the case of three analyses with $\alpha = .05$. This means that for each statistical test, we must achieve $p < .017$ to report a statistically significant result. An alternative which allows us to achieve the same number of statistically significant results is to multiply the unadjusted per analysis p-values for each statistical test by the number of tests. For example, if we run three statistical tests and receive $p = .014$, $p = .047$, and $p = .125$, we would achieve one significant result with the first method ($p < .017$) as well as with the alternative since the first statistical test satisfies the per analysis error rate ($p < .05$): $p = .014 * 3 = .042$.
  
  Perneger (1998) is one of many who oppose the use of the Bonferroni Correction, suggesting that these "adjustments are, at best, unnecessary and, at worst, deleterious to sound statistical inference." The Bonferroni Correction is controversial among researchers because while applying the correction reduces the chance of a Type I error, it also increases the chance of a Type II error. Because this correction makes it more difficult to detect significant results, it is rare to find such a correction reported in published research, though research often involves multiple testing on the same sample. Perneger suggests that simply describing the statistical tests that were performed, and why, is sufficient for dealing with potential problems introduced by multiple testing.
