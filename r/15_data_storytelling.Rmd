## Know Your Audience

## Intro

  Studies show that our audience determines in 3-8 seconds whether or not to give us their attention based on what we have put in front of them (Knaflic, 2015). Therefore, it is crucial to let the audience know upfront what we are going to share with them and why it is worth their time and attention.

## TL;DR

## Versioning

## Outline the Story

  When preparing a presentation, never begin with slides. The aesthetics and effects are of secondary importance to the organization and sequencing of content. Begin by outlining the structure and organizing content and key messages in a way that supports and punctuates the key messages you wish to convey to the audience. The outline can then be translated into a presentation-ready deck or document, which will have a higher likelihood of logical and effective information flow.
