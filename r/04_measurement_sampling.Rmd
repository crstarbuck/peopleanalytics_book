# Measurement & Sampling {#measure-sampl}

## Variable Types

  The framing of variables in research hypotheses guides the treatment of each in our analyses. In this section, we will discuss the function of *independent*, *dependent*, *control*, *moderating*, and *mediating* variables.

### Independent Variables (IV)

  An **Independent Variable (IV)** is a variable which is assumed to have a direct effect on another variable. IVs are sometimes referred to as *predictors*, *factors*, *features*, *antecedents*, or *explanatory* variables.
  
  For example, we may wish to examine whether an inclusion training program given to a random sample of leaders has a positive effect on team-level belonging favorability. In a true experimental design, participation in the inclusion training would be the only difference between the treatment (teams whose leaders who participate in the training) and the control (teams whose leaders who do not participate in the training). In this case, inclusion training participation is the IV (the variable we are manipulating).
  
  IVs are also present in non-experimental designs. For example, we may survey employees and ask them to rate their leader's inclusiveness and also provide self-reported belonging ratings. In this context, leader inclusiveness (rather than an inclusion training) is the IV. If we find that average team-level belonging scores tend to be higher when leader inclusiveness scores are higher, this *may* indicate that leader inclusion has some degree of influence on team-level belonging. Of course, there could be alternative explanations for any observed differences in team-level belonging, which is why experimental designs tend to provide stronger evidence for an IV's effect.

### Dependent Variables (DV)

  A **Dependent Variable (DV)** is a variable that is *dependent* on the IV. DVs are also referred to as *outcome*, *response*, or *criterion* variables.
  
  In our leader inclusion example, team-level belonging is the DV since this variable is assumed to depend on the level of team leaders' inclusiveness. It's important to note that regardless of a study's results, it is the positioning of the variables in the study's hypotheses (rooted in theory) that determines the type of variable. If we hypothesize that leader inclusion training has a positive effect on team-level belonging, but the study finds no such effect, the inclusion intervention is still the IV and team-level belonging the DV.

### Control Variables (CV)

  A **Control Variable (CV)** is a variable that is held constant in research. The unchanging state of a CV allows us to understand the extent to which the IV has a unique and independent effect on the DV.
  
  In an experimental context, control variables represent a researcher's attempt to control for alternative explanations so that the IV's main effect on the DV can be isolated. For example, in our leader inclusion example, in order to be confident that the reason for any observed differences in team-level belonging can be attributed to leader inclusion training rather than other factors that theoretically may explain differences. For example, we should ensure that the two groups are similar with respect to characteristics such as gender and ethnicity, since underrepresented groups (URGs) may have different experiences independent of any training programs. In this case, gender and ethnicity are CVs.
  
  While we control for the effects of alternative explanations by way of the research design in an experiemental context, we will discuss ways to control for these statistically in Chapter \@ref(lm) for correlational designs. CVs are equally important in experimental and non-experimental contexts.

### Moderating Variables

  A **Moderating Variable** influences the strength of the effect of an IV on a DV. Moderating variables are often referred to as *interactions* or *interaction terms* in models.
  
  Moderating variables may augment (strengthen) or attenuate (weaken) the effect one variable has on another. Interactions are widely understood in the context of medications; one drug may independently have a positive effect on one's health but when combined with another medication, the interaction can behave very differently -- and may even be lethal! In our inclusive leadership example, we may find that the strength of the training's effect on team-level belonging varies based on a leader's span of control (SoC). It stands to reason that leaders with a lower SoC may find it easier to cultivate a climate of inclusivity and belonging, while leaders with a higher SoC may have more scope/projects and team dynamics to manage and may find it more difficult to consistently apply strategies covered during the training. 
  
  Interactions between variables are vital to our understanding of nuance and complexity in the dynamics influencing outcomes in organizational settings. Chapter \@ref(lm) will cover how to test for significant interactions.

### Mediating Variables

  A **Mediating Variable** explains the *how* or *why* of an IV's effect on a DV. It may be helpful to think of mediating variables as a "go-between" -- a part of the causal pathway of an effect.
  
  In the case of inclusive leadership training, effects on belonging are likely not the result of the training itself. More likely, the training raised awareness and helped leaders develop strategies to help cultivate team inclusivity. One strategy endorsed during the training may be participative decision making, and the implementation of this strategy may explain **why** the training has a positive effect on team-level belonging. There may be multiple mediators of any observed effect of the intervention on team-level belonging depending on training outcomes.
  
  Mediating variables may fully or partially mediate the relationship between an IV and DV. **Full mediation** indicates that the mediator fully explains the effect; in other words, without the mediator in the model, there is no relationship between an IV and DV. **Partial mediation** indicates that the mediator partially explains the effect; that is, there is still a relationship between an IV and DV without the mediator in the model. Partial mediation indicates that there are additional explanations for *how* or *why* observed effects exist, such as the implementation of additional team inclusion strategies influencing team belonging. In Chapter \@ref(lm), we will discuss how to test for both full and partial mediation.
  
  Translating research hypotheses into conceptual models of hypothesized relationships is helpful in visually representing the function of each variable in the study. Figure \@ref(fig:concept-mdl) illustrates how each type of variable is depicted using our inclusive leadership example:

```

## Measurement Scales

  **Measurement scales** are used to categorize and quantify variables. There are two major categorizations -- *discrete* and *continuous* -- and these, together with the research hypotheses, help determine appropriate types of analyses to perform.

### Discrete Variables

  **Discrete variables** are also known as *categorical* or *qualitative* variables. Categorical variables have a finite or countable number of values associated with them, and these can be further categorized as either *nominal* or *ordinal*.

  **Nominal**

  A **nominal** variable is one with two or more categories for which there is no intrinsic ordering to the categories. Examples of nominal variables include office locations, departments, and teams. A **dichotomous variable** is a type of nominal variable which has only two unordered categories. Examples of dichotomous variables include people leader vs. individual contributor, active vs. inactive status, and remote worker vs. non-remote worker.

  **Ordinal**

  An **ordinal** variable is similar to a nominal variable with one important difference: ordinal variables have *ordered* categories. Examples of ordinal variables include education levels, job levels, and survey variables measured on Likert-type scales.

### Continuous Variables

  **Continuous variables** are also known as *quantitative* variables. Continuous variables can assume any real value in some interval, and these can be further categorized as either *interval* or *ratio* variables.

  **Interval**
  
  Variables measured on an **interval** scale have a natural order and a quantifiable difference between values but no absolute zero value. Examples include SAT scores, IQ scores, and temperature measured in Fahrenheit or Celsius (but not Kelvin). In these examples, 0 is either not an option (i.e., SAT and IQ) or does not represent the absence of something (e.g., 0 degrees is a temperature, albeit a cold one!).
  
  **Ratio**

  Variables measured on a **ratio** scale have the same properties as data measured on an interval scale with one important difference: ratio data have an absolute zero value. Examples include compensation, revenue, and sales; a zero in these contexts is possible and would indicate a true absence of something.

## Sampling

  The goal of research is to understand a population based on data from a subset of population members. In practice, it is often not feasible to collect data from every member of a population, so we instead calculate **sample statistics** to estimate **population parameters**.

  Another important concept is the **sampling frame**. While the population represents the entire group of interest, the sampling frame represents the subset of the population to which the researcher has access. In an ideal setting, the population and sampling frame are the same, but they are often different in practice. For example, a professor may be interested in understanding student sentiment about a new school policy but only has access to collect data from students in the courses she teaches. In this case, the entire student body is the population but the students she has access to (those in the courses she teaches) represent the sampling frame. The sample is the subset of the sampling frame that ultimately participates in the research (e.g,. those who complete a survey or participate in a focus group).
