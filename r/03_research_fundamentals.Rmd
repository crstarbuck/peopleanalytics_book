## Research Methods

  There are three major categories of research methods: (1) *quantitative*, (2) *qualitative*, and (3) *mixed methods*.
  
  1. **Quantitative**
     * Addresses "what" questions
     * Utilizes numerical data (e.g., surveys, systems)
     * Primarily deductive
     * Used to test hypotheses
     * Involves statistical analyses
     * More objective
     * More generalizable
  
  2. **Qualitative**
     * Addresses "how" and "why" questions
     * Utilizes text data (e.g., focus groups, interviews, open-ended feedback)
     * Primarily inductive
     * Used to formulate theory or hypotheses
     * Involves organizing data into categories or themes
     * More subjective
     * Less generalizable
  
  3. **Mixed Methods**
     * Integrates the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative methods within a single study, often leading with qualitative approaches to build theory and hypotheses followed by quantitative methods to test hypotheses

## Research Questions

  **Research questions** are fundamental to all research projects. Research questions help focus the study, determine the appropriate methodology, and guide each stage of inquiry, analysis, and reporting. Some examples of research questions germane to people analytics include:
  
  $Q_1$: Why has there been an increase in attrition over the past quarter?
  $Q_2$: How equitable are promotion nominations across the organization?
  $Q_3$: Are there meaningful differences in the favorability of experiences for remote vs. non-remote employees?
  $Q_4$: Do new joiners have the training and resources they need to be successful?
  $Q_5$: What portion of team performance is attributable to leadership effectiveness?
  
## Research Hypotheses

  **Research hypotheses** are testable statements about the expected outcome of a research project or experiment.
  
  $H_1$: Manager satisfaction is a significant predictor of voluntary attrition.
  $H_2$: Promotion nomination rates are not significantly different by gender and ethnicity.
  $H_3$: Employee experience favorability is not significantly different between remote and non-remote workers.
  $H_4$: New hire training perceptions are positively associated with onboarding experience favorability.
  $H_5$: Leadership effectiveness perceptions explain significant variation in team performance.

## Internal vs. External Validity

  **Internal validity** refers to the extent to which confounding variables are controlled. In other words, internal validity reflects the *robustness* of the study.
  
  For example, if a study finds a significant relationship between work location and attrition but considers no other factors or explanations, this would *not* be a robust study. Work location may emerge significant because certain roles for which attrition is higher are more concentrated in one or more geographies. It could also be the case that the company has made acquisitions in new geogrphies, and the acquired employees have significantly different experiences (and attrition rates) relative to non-acquired employees. 
  
  **Confounding variables** are critically important in the context of internal validity. A confounding variable is an extraneous variable whose presence impacts the variables being studied such that results do not reflect the actual relationships. Studies with weak internal validity often result in spurious associations that *confound* the true relationship between two variables, leading to invalid conclusions and recommendations.
  
  **External validity** refers to the extent to which study conclusions will hold in other contexts (for other people, in other places, at other times). *Randomization* is fundamental to our ability to generalize and apply findings to other groups or contexts.
  
  If we survey employees to understand sentiments about recent changes in business strategy, but exclude groups for which there may be different impacts or perceptions, conclusions about the collective sentiment would be suspect at best.
