# Research Fundamentals {#research}


## Research Questions

  **Research questions** are fundamental to all research projects. Research questions help focus the study, determine the appropriate methodology, and guide each stage of inquiry, analysis, and reporting. Some examples of research questions germane to people analytics include:
  
  * $Q_1$: Why has there been an increase in attrition over the past quarter?
  * $Q_2$: How equitable are promotion nominations across the organization?
  * $Q_3$: Are there meaningful differences in the favorability of experiences for remote vs. non-remote employees?
  * $Q_4$: Do new joiners have the training and resources they need to be successful?
  * $Q_5$: What portion of team performance is attributable to leadership effectiveness?
  
## Research Hypotheses

  **Research hypotheses** are testable statements about the expected outcome of a research project or experiment.
  
  * $H_1$: Manager satisfaction is a significant predictor of voluntary attrition.
  * $H_2$: Promotion nomination rates are not significantly different by gender and ethnicity.
  * $H_3$: Employee experience favorability is not significantly different between remote and non-remote workers.
  * $H_4$: New hire training perceptions are positively associated with onboarding experience favorability.
  * $H_5$: Leadership effectiveness perceptions explain significant variation in team performance.
  
## Internal vs. External Validity

  **Internal validity** refers to the extent to which confounding variables are controlled. In other words, internal validity reflects the *robustness* of the study.
  
  For example, if a study finds a significant relationship between work location and attrition but considers no other factors or explanations, this would *not* be a robust study. Work location may emerge significant because certain roles for which attrition is higher are more concentrated in one or more geographies. It could also be the case that the company has made acquisitions in new geogrphies, and the acquired employees have significantly different experiences (and attrition rates) relative to non-acquired employees. 
  
  **Confounding variables** are critically important in the context of internal validity. A confounding variable is an extraneous variable whose presence impacts the variables being studied such that results do not reflect the actual relationships. Studies with weak internal validity often result in spurious associations that *confound* the true relationship between two variables, leading to invalid conclusions and recommendations.
  
  **External validity** refers to the extent to which study conclusions will hold in other contexts (for other people, in other places, at other times). *Randomization* is fundamental to our ability to generalize and apply findings to other groups or contexts.
  
  If we survey employees to understand sentiments about recent changes in business strategy, but exclude groups for which there may be different impacts or perceptions, conclusions about the collective sentiment would be suspect at best. 
  
## Research Methods

  There are three major categories of research methods: (1) *quantitative*, (2) *qualitative*, and (3) *mixed methods*.
  
  1. **Quantitative**
     * Addresses "what" questions
     * Utilizes numerical data (e.g., surveys, systems)
     * Primarily deductive
     * Used to test hypotheses
     * Involves statistical analyses
     * More objective
     * More generalizable
  
  2. **Qualitative**
     * Addresses "how" and "why" questions
     * Utilizes text data (e.g., focus groups, interviews, open-ended feedback)
     * Primarily inductive
     * Used to formulate theory or hypotheses
     * Involves organizing data into categories or themes
     * More subjective
     * Less generalizable
  
  3. **Mixed Methods**
     * Integrates the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative methods within a single study, often leading with qualitative approaches to build theory and hypotheses followed by quantitative methods to test hypotheses

## Research Designs

  In addition to determining whether a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods study is most appropriate, researchers also need to decide on the type of study within each of these three. **Research designs** are the types of inquiry within quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches that issue specific direction for the research procedures (Creswell, 2018). There are multiple taxonomies for research designs, and we will simplify to the most common types.
  
  Within the quantitative category, there are three types of designs: (a) *experimental*, (b) *quasi-experimental*, and (c) *correlational*. As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:res-designs), it is important to understand the centrality of randomization in this decision.

  **Experimental Research**

  **Experimental research** is concerned with casual (internal) validity. Randomized experimental designs provide the most rigor with regard to causal validity. However, in social science research contexts, true experiments often are not possible due to ethical considerations.
  
  For example, if we were interested in understanding the causal effect leadership quality has on employee engagement, based on a hypothesis that poor leadership decreases employee engagement, we would need to randomly assign employees to one of two groups that are identical on the basis of all variables that could theoretically explain why employees vary in their levels of engagement. Then, we would need to manipulate the variable of interest (leadership quality) to evaluate if the group of employees subjected to poor leadership (treatment group) reports significantly different levels of engagement relative to the group of employees for whom leadership quality has not been manipulated (control group). In a practical setting, it would of course be unethical to purposefully subject employees to poor leadership with the expectation of reducing engagement -- and consequently, retention, productivity, and impact to the organization.
  
  Clinical trials are a common setting for true experiments, as isolating the effects of an experimental drug can be a matter of life or death. In a randomized clinical trial, patients are randomly assigned to an experimental group (patients who receive the drug) or control group (patients who receive a placebo). In order to protect against placebo effects biasing the results, patients do not know if they receive the experimental treatment or the placebo. Done correctly, these experiments have the highest level of internal validity.
  
  Another example of an experiemental design is **A/B testing**. A/B testing is often performed in the context of website optimization, in which two or more versions of the site are shown to customers to identify which version impacts key success metrics more positively. In a people analytics context, we may create two versions of a dashboard and *randomly* assign the permissioned users to each. We could then assess whether utilization rates, average usage time, repeat usage, among other success measures are significantly different between the two groups of users to inform which design is most effective.
