## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is an excellent tool when the outcome is categorical. Logistic regression allows us to model the probability of different classes -- a type of modeling often referred to as classification. The context for classification can be binomial for two classes (e.g., active/inactive, promoted/not promoted), multinomial for multiple unordered classes (e.g., skills, job families), or ordinal for multiple ordered classes (e.g., survey items measured on a Likert scale, performance level).
