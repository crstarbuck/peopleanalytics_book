# Unsupervised Learning {#unsup-lrn}

  The inferential and predictive models covered thus far can be categorized as **supervised learning** models. For each observation $x_i$ in the data, there is an associated response $y_i$ in a supervised learning setting, and the goal is to fit a model that relates $y$ to one or more predictors to understand relationships or predict future values on the basis of the identified associations. However, in an **unsupervised learning** setting, no response $y_i$ is associated with $x_i$. As a result, we cannot *supervise* the analysis and are limited to understanding how observations cluster or group together based on patterns across the available $p$ attributes.

  People analytics often involves the unique challenge of analyzing high-dimensional data with a large number of $p$ attributes but relatively few $n$ observations -- a phenomenon often referred to as the *curse of dimensionality*. Given the sample size requirements covered in previous chapters, we ideally want $n$ to be an order of magnitude larger than $p$ to support statistical power and increase our chances of detecting meaningful patterns and population effects in sample data. Since people data sets are often wide and short, **dimension reduction** is important for reducing the dimensions to a limited subset that captures the majority of the information and optimizes the $n:p$ ratio.
  
  Consider a case in which a colleague uses verbose rhetoric to convey a simple message that could be effectively communicated with fewer words. The superfluous language is unnecessary and does not provide additional information or value. This is analogous to dimension reduction in that we are interested in identifying a limited set of meaningful attributes and discarding redundant and unimportant information that does not contribute to the analysis objectives.
  
  Dimension reduction is most common in the context of surveys. Survey instrumentation with strong psychometric properties features highly correlated survey items for constructs, or individual dimensions of multidimensional constructs, that are relatively uncorrelated with survey items used to measure independent constructs. Intuitively, we know that highly correlated variables do not individually capture unique information, as one is a sufficient proxy to capture the available signal in the data. Dimension reduction is particularly important in survey research because longer surveys are costly and may result in lower response rates due to the increased completion time requirements.
  
  This chapter will cover dimension reduction fundamentals as well as technical implementation frameworks germane to people analytics.
