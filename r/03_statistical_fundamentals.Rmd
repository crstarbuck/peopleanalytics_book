# Statistical Fundamentals

This chapter surveys a number of univariate, bivariate, and inferential analysis concepts that underpin the more complex multivariate approaches in subsequent chapters of this book.

## Populations & Samples

The goal of research is to understand a population based on data from a subset of population members. In practice, it is often not feasible to collect data from every member of a population, so we instead calculate **sample statistics** -- such as people who participate in a survey -- in order to estimate **population parameters**.

Another important concept is the **sampling frame**. While the population represents the entire group of interest, the sampling frame represents the subset of the population to which the researcher has access. In an ideal setting, the population and sampling frame are the same, but they are often different in practice. For example, a professor may be interested in understanding student sentiment about a new school policy but only has access to collect data from students in the courses she teaches. In this case, the entire student body is the population but the students she has access to (those in the courses she teaches) represent the sampling frame. The sample is the subset of the sampling frame that ultimately participates in the research (e.g,. those who complete a survey or participate in a focus group).

## Univariate Analysis

Descriptive statistics are rudimentary analysis techniques that help describe and summarize data in a meaningful way. Descriptive statistics do not allow us to draw any conclusions beyond the available data but are helpful in interpreting the data at hand.

There are two categories of descriptive statistics: (1) measures of central tendency and (2) measures of spread. Measures of central tendency describe the central position in a set of data, while measures of spread describe how dispersed the data are.

### Measures of Central Tendency

  **Mean**
  
  Perhaps the most intuitive measure of central tendency is the mean, which is often referred to as the average. The mean of a sample is denoted by $\bar{x}$ and is defined by:
  
  $$ \bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n} $$

The mean of a set of numeric values can be calculated using the mean() function in R:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Fill vector x with integers
x <- c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,50)

# Calculate average of vector x
mean(x)

```

  **Median**
  
  The median represents the midpoint in a sorted vector of numbers. For vectors with an even number of values, the median is the average of the middle two numbers; it is simply the middle number for vectors with an odd number of values. When the distribution of data is skewed, or there is an extreme value like we observe in vector x, the median is a better measure of central tendency. 
  
  The median() function in R can be used to handle the sorting and midpoint selection:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate median of vector x
median(x)

```
  
  In this example, the median is only 2 compared with the mean of 6.9 (which is not really representative of any of the values in vector x). Large deltas between mean and median values are evidence of outliers.
  
  **Mode**
  
  The mode is the most frequent number in a set of values.
  
  While mean() and median() are standard functions in R, mode() returns the internal storage mode of the object rather than the statistical mode of the data. We can easily create a function to return the statistical mode(s):
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Create function to calculate statistical mode(s)
stat.mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  tab <- tabulate(match(x, ux))
  ux[tab == max(tab)]
}

# Return mode(s) of vector x
stat.mode(x)

```
  
  In this case, we have a bimodal distribution since both 1 and 2 occur most frequently.
  
  **Range**
  
  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a set of numbers. 
  
  The range() function in R returns the minimum and maximum numbers:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return lowest and highest values of vector x
range(x)

```

We can leverage the max() and min() functions to calculate the difference between these values:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate range of vector x
max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)

```

### Measures of Spread

  **Variance**
  
  Variance is a measure of the variability around the average value. Variance is calculated using the average of squared differences from the mean.
  
  Variance of a population is defined by:
  
  $$ \sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum (X_{i}-\mu)^{2}}{N} $$
  
  Variance of a sample is defined by:
  
  $$ s^{2} = \frac{\sum (x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1} $$
  
  It is important to note that since differences are squared, the variance is always non-negative. In addition, we cannot compare these squared differences to the arithmetic mean since the units are different. For example, if we calculate the variance of total working years measured in USD, variance should be expressed as USD squared while the mean exists in the original USD unit of measurement.
 
 In R, the sample variance can be calculated using the var() function:
 
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Load library for data wrangling
library(dplyr)

# Read employee tenure data
demographics <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crstarbuck/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/master/data/files/employee_demographics.csv")

# Calculate sample variance for annual compensation
var(demographics$annual_comp)

```

  Sample statistics are the default in R. Since the population variance differs from the sample variance by a factor of `var(vector) * (n - 1) / n`, it is simple to convert output from var() to the population variance:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Store number of observations
n = nrow(demographics)

# Calculate population variance for annual compensation
var(demographics$annual_comp) * (n - 1) / n

```

  **Standard Deviation**
  
  The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance, as defined by:
  
  $$ s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}}{N - 1}} $$
  
  Since a squared value can be converted back to its original units by taking its square root, the standard deviation expresses variability around the mean in the variable's original units.
  
   In R, the sample standard deviation can be calculated using the sd() function:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate sample standard deviation for annual compensation
sd(demographics$annual_comp)

```

  Since the population standard deviation differs from the sample standard deviation by a factor of `sd(vector) * sqrt((n - 1) / n)`, it is simple to convert output from sd() to the population standard deviation:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate population standard deviation for annual compensation
sd(demographics$annual_comp) * sqrt((n - 1) / n)

```

  **Quartiles**
  
  Quartiles are a staple of exploratory data analysis (EDA). A quartile is a type of quantile that partitions data into four equally sized parts (with regard to the number of data points in each quartile, not the range of values) after ordering the data. Quartiles also correspond to percentiles. For example, Q1 is the 25th percentile -- the value below which 25% of values exist.
  
  The Interquartile Range (IQR) represents the difference between Q3 and Q1 cutpoint values (the middle two quartiles). The IQR is sometimes used to detect extreme values in a distribution. Values less than `Q1 - 1.5 * IQR` or greater than `Q3 + 1.5 * IQR` are generally considered outliers.
  
  In R, the quantile() function returns the values that bookend each quartile:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return quartiles for annual compensation
quantile(demographics$annual_comp)

```

  Based on this output, we know that 25% of people in our data earn annual compensation of 87,946 USD or less, 125,522 USD is the median annual compensation, and 75% of people earn annual compensation of 163,263 USD or less.
  
  We can also return a specific percentile value using the `probs` argument in the quantile() function. For example, if we want to know the 80th percentile annual compensation value, we can execute the following:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return 80th percentile annual compensation value
quantile(demographics$annual_comp, probs = .8)

```

  In addition, the summary() function returns several common descriptive statistics for an object:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return common descriptives
summary(demographics$annual_comp)

```

### Bivariate Analysis  

  **Covariance**
  
  While variance provides an understanding of how values for a single variable vary, covariance is an unstandardized measure of how two variables vary together. Values can range from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, and these values can be used to understand the direction of the linear relationship between variables. Positive covariance values indicate that the variables vary in the same direction (e.g., tend to increase or decrease together), while negative covariance values indicate that the variables vary in opposite directions (e.g., when one increases, the other decreases, or vice versa).
  
  Covariance of a sample is defined by:

$$ cov_{x,y} = \frac{\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})}{N-1} $$

  It's important to note that while covariance aids our understanding of the direction of the relationship between two variables, we cannot use it to understand the strength of the association since it is unstandardized. Due to differences in variables' units of measurement, the strength of the relationship between two variables with large covariance could be weak, while the strength of the relationship between another pair of variables with small covariance could be strong. 
  
  In R, we can compute the covariance between a pair of numeric variables using the cov() function:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate sample covariance between annual compensation and age using complete observations (missing values will cause issues if not addressed)
cov(demographics$annual_comp, demographics$age, use = "complete.obs")

```
  
  In this example, using the default Pearson method, the covariance between annual compensation and age is 453179.1. The positive value indicates that annual compensation is generally higher for older employees and lower for younger employees.
  
  Just as we multiplied the sample variance by `(n - 1) / n` to obtain the population variance, we can apply the same approach to convert the sample covariance returned by cov() to the population covariance:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate population covariance between annual compensation and age
cov(demographics$annual_comp, demographics$age, use = "complete.obs") * (n - 1) / n

```

  **Correlation**

  Correlation is a scaled form of covariance. While covariance provides an unstandardized measure of the direction of a relationship between variables, correlation provides a standardized measure that can be used to quantify both the direction and strength of bivariate relationships. Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfectly negative association, 1 indicates a perfectly positive association, and 0 indicates the absence of an association. Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient $r$ is defined by:

$$ r_{x,y} = \frac{\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_(x_{i}-\bar{x})^2\sum_(y_{i}-\bar{y})^2}} $$

  In R, Pearson's correlation coefficient $r$ can be calculated using the cor() function:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate the correlation between annual compensation and age
cor(demographics$annual_comp, demographics$age, use = "complete.obs")

```

  While we knew the relationship between annual compensation and age is positive based on the positive covariance coefficient, Pearson's $r$ of .81 indicates that the strength of the positive association is strong ($r$ = 1 is perfectly positive).
  
  There are several correlation coefficients, and the measurement scale of `x` and `y` determine the appropriate type:
  
<br />

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Proper Applications of Correlation Coefficients', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/correlation_table.png")

```

<br />
  
  Pearson's $r$ can be used when both variables are measured on continuous scales or when one is continuous and the other is dichotomous (point-biserial correlation).
  
  When one or both variables are ordinal, we can leverage Spearman's $\rho$ or Kendall's $\tau$, which are both standardized nonparametric measures of the association between one or two rank-ordered variables. Let's look at Spearman's $\rho$, which is defined as:
  
  $$ \rho = 1 - {\frac {6 \sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}} $$
  
  We can override the default Pearson method in the cor() function to implement a specific form of rank correlation using the `method` argument:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate the correlation between job level and education level using Spearman's method
cor(demographics$job_level, demographics$education, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")

```

  The $\rho$ coefficient of .67 indicates that the positive association we observed between job level and education level is strong. We could also pass `method = "kendall"` to this cor() function to implement Kendall's $\tau$.
  
  The Phi Coefficient ($\phi$), sometimes referred to as the mean square contingency coefficient or Matthews correlation in ML, can be used to understand the association between two dichotomous variables. For a 2x2 table for two random variables $x$ and $y$:
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = '2x2 Table for Random Variables x and y', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/phi_coefficient_formula.png")

```

  The $\phi$ coefficient is defined as:
  
  $$ \phi = {\frac {(AD-BC)}{\sqrt{(A+B)(C+D)(A+C)(B+D)}}} $$
  
  To illustrate, let's examine whether there is a relationship between gender and performance after transforming performance from its ordinal form to a dichotomous variables (high vs. low performance). We can leverage the `psych` library to calculate $\phi$ in R:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Load library for Phi Coefficient
library(psych)

# Set females to 1 and everything else to 0
demographics$gender_code <- ifelse(demographics$gender == 'Female', 1, 0)

# Set high performers (3 and above) to 1 and everything else to 0
demographics$performance_code <- ifelse(demographics$performance < 3, 0, 1)

# Create a 2x2 contingency table
contingency_tbl <- table(demographics$gender_code, demographics$performance_code)

# Calculate the Phi Coefficient between dichotomous variables
phi(contingency_tbl)

``` 
  
  $\phi$ is essentially 0, which means performance ratings are distributed equitably across gender categories (good news!).
  
  The examples thus far have examined associations between only two variables at a time. However, rather than looking at individual pairwise relationships, we can easily produce a correlation matrix to surface associations among many variables:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Generate a correlation matrix between continuous variables
cor(demographics[, c("annual_comp", "age", "org_tenure", "job_tenure")], use = "complete.obs")

```

  Based on this correlation matrix, there are several strong pairwise associations in the data. The values down the diagonal are 1 because these represent the correlation between each variable and itself. You may also notice that the information above and below the diagonal is identical and, therefore, redundant.
  
  A great R library for visualizing correlation matrices is corrplot. Several arguments can be specified for various visual representations of the relationships among variables:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Load library for correlation visuals
library(corrplot)

# Store correlation matrix to object M
M <- cor(demographics[, c("annual_comp", "age", "org_tenure", "job_tenure")], method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")

# Visualize correlation matrix
corrplot.mixed(M, order = 'AOE')

```

  It's important to remember that correlation is not causation. Correlations can be spurious (variables related by chance), and drawing conclusions based on bivariate associations alone -- especially without drawing on theory -- can be dangerous. Here are two examples of nearly perfect correlations between variables for which there is unlikely a true direct association:
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Correlation between Maine Divorce Rate and Margarine Consumption (r = .99)', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/spurious_corr_maine_divorce.png")

```
  
<br />
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Correlation between Mozzarella Cheese Consumption and Civil Engineering Doctorate Conferrals (r = .96)', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/spurious_corr_mozzarella_cheese.png")

```

## Inferential Statistics

The objective of inferential statistics is to make inferences -- with some degree of confidence -- about a population based on available sample data. Several related concepts underpin this goal and will be covered here.

### Introduction to Probability



### Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a mainstay of statistics and probability and fundamental to understanding the mechanics of inferential analysis techniques we will cover later in this book. The CLT was initially coined by a French-born mathematician named Abraham De Moivre in the 1700s. While initially unpopular, it was later reintroduced and attracted new interest from theorists and academics (Daw & Pearson, 1972). 

The CLT states that the average of independent random variables, when increased in number, tend to follow a normal distribution. The distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution regardless of the shape of the population distribution from which the samples are drawn. This is important because the normal distribution has properties that can be used to test the likelihood that an observed difference or relationship in a sample is also present in the population.

If we need to estimate the average value of a population, for example, we can lean on the CLT and normal distribution properties to obtain the range of values that are likely to include the true population average. This is how confidence intervals are defined, which enable us to make reasonable inferences about the unknown population parameters based on sample data.

<br />

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'The Empirical Rule', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/normal_distribution.png")

```

<br />

Let's begin with an intuitive example of CLT. Imagine that we have a reliable way to measure how fun a population is on a 100-point scale, where 100 indicates maximum fun (life of the party) and 1 indicates relative boringness. Consider that a small statistics conference is in progress at a nearby convention center, and there are 40 statisticians in attendance. In a separate room at the same convention center, there is also a group of 40 random people (non-statisticians) who are gathered to discuss some less interesting topic. Our job is to walk into one of the rooms and determine -- on the basis of the "fun" factor alone -- whether we have entered the statistics conference or the other, less interesting gathering of non-statisticians.

Let's assume the mean fun score and standard deviation of these two groups are known; the group of statisticians have, on average, a fun score of 85 with a standard deviation of 2, while the group of non-statisticians are a bit less fun with a mean score of 65 and a standard deviation of 4. With a known population mean and standard deviation, the standard error (the standard deviation of the sample means) provides the ability to calculate the probability that the sample (the room of 40 people) belongs to the population of interest (fellow statisticians).

Herein lies the beauty of the CLT: roughly 68 percent of sample means will lie within one standard error of the population mean, roughly 95 percent within two standard errors of the population mean, and roughly 99 percent within three standard errors of the population mean. Therefore, any room whose members have an average fun score that is not within two standard errors of the population mean (between 81 and 89 for our statisticians) is statistically unlikely to be the group of statisticians for which we are searching. This is because in less than 5 in 100 cases could we randomly draw a 'reasonably sized' sample of statisticians with average funness so extremely different from the population average. 

Because small samples lend to anamalies, we could -- by chance -- select a single person who happens to fall in the tails (relatively boring or extremely fun); however, as the sample size increases, it becomes more and more likely that the observed average reflects the average of the larger population. It would be virtually impossible (in less than 1 in 100 cases) to draw a random sample of statisticians from the population with average funness that is not within three standard errors of the population mean (between 79 and 91). Therefore, if we find that the room of people have an average fun score of 75, we will likely have far more fun in the other room!

Let's now see the CLT in action by simulating a random uniform population distribution from which we can draw random samples. Remember, the shape of the population distribution does not matter; we could simulate an Exponential, Gamma, Poisson, Binomial, or other distribution and observe the same behavior.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Load library for data viz
library(ggplot2)

# Set seed for reproducible random distribution
set.seed(1234)

# Generate uniform population distribution with 1000 values ranging from 1 to 100
rand.unif <- runif(1000, min = 1, max = 100)

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate population mean
mean(rand.unif)

```

```{r, fig.cap = "Uniform Population Distribution (N = 1000)", fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE}

# Produce histogram to visualize population distribution
ggplot() + 
  aes(rand.unif) + 
  labs(x = "x", y = "N") + 
  geom_histogram(colour = "white", size = .1, fill = "#262626")

```

As expected, these randomly generated data are uniformly distributed. Next, we will draw 100 random samples of various sizes and plot the average of each.

```{r, fig.cap = "Distribution of 100 Sample Means of Varied Size", fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE}

# Define number of samples to draw from population distribution
samples <- 100

# Populate vector with sample sizes
sample_n <- c(1:5,10,25,50)

# Initialize empty data frame to hold sample means
sample_means = NULL

# Set seed for reproducible random samples
set.seed(456)

# For each n, draw random samples
for (n in sample_n) {
  
  for (draw in 1:samples) {
    
      # Store sample means in data frame
      sample_means <- rbind(sample_means, cbind.data.frame(
                            n = n, 
                            x_bar = mean(sample(rand.unif, n, replace = TRUE, prob = NULL))))
  }
}

# Produce histograms to visualize distributions of sample means
sample_means %>% ggplot() + 
  aes(x = x_bar, fill = n) + 
  labs(x = "x-bar", y = "n") + 
  geom_histogram(colour = "white", size = .1, fill = "#262626") + 
  facet_wrap(~n)

```

Per the CLT, we can see that as n increases, the sample means become more normally distributed.

### Confidence Intervals

  A Confidence Interval (CI) is a range of values that likely includes an unknown population value, as defined by:
  
  $$ CI = \bar{X} \pm z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$
  
  A related concept that is fundamental to estimating CIs is the standard error. The standard error (SE) is the standard deviation of sample means. While the standard deviation is a measure of variability for random variables, the variability captured by the SE reflects how representative the sample is of the population. Since sample statistics will approach the actual population parameters as the size of the sample increases, the SE and sample size are inversely related; that is, the SE decreases as the sample size increases. The SE is defined by:
  
  $$ SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$
  
  Next, let's validate that our simulated distribution of sample means adheres to the properties of normally distributed data per the Empirical Rule:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Store sample means with n = 50
x_bars <- sample_means[sample_means$n == 50, "x_bar"]

# Store sample size
n <- length(x_bars)

# Calculate percent of sample means within +/- 2 SEs
length(x_bars[x_bars < mean(x_bars) + 2 * sd(x_bars) & x_bars > mean(x_bars) - 2 * sd(x_bars)]) / n * 100

```

  97% of sample means are within 2 SEs, which is roughly what we expect per the characteristics of the normal distribution. 
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate percent of sample means within +/- 3 SEs
length(x_bars[x_bars < mean(x_bars) + 3 * sd(x_bars) & x_bars > mean(x_bars) - 3 * sd(x_bars)]) / n * 100

```

  All of the sample means are within 3 SEs, indicating that it would be highly unlikely -- nearly impossible even -- to observe a sample mean `from the same population` that falls outside this interval.
  
  Now, let's illustrate the relationship between CIs and standard errors:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate 95% CI
ci95_lower_bound <- mean(x_bars) - 1.96 * (sd(x_bars) / sqrt(n))
ci95_upper_bound <- mean(x_bars) + 1.96 * (sd(x_bars) / sqrt(n))

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print lower bound for 95% CI
ci95_lower_bound

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print upper bound for 95% CI
ci95_upper_bound

```
  
  The 95% CI corresponds to a z-score of 1.96, which is simply the number of SEs we expect to include the true population average -- at least in 95 of 100 random samples taken from said population. In this example, we know that our population mean is 51.2, which is covered by our 95% CI (50.8 - 52.3). Note that our CI narrows with larger samples since our confidence that the range includes the population average increases with more data.

  Next, let's look at a 99% CI. We will use a z-score of 2.58 for this:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate 99% CI
ci99_lower_bound <- mean(x_bars) - 2.58 * (sd(x_bars) / sqrt(n))
ci99_upper_bound <- mean(x_bars) + 2.58 * (sd(x_bars) / sqrt(n))

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print lower bound for 99% CI
ci99_lower_bound

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print upper bound for 99% CI
ci99_upper_bound

```
  
  Like the 95% CI, this slightly wider 99% CI (50.5 - 52.5) also includes the true population mean of 51.2.
  
  **Hypothesis Testing**

Hypothesis testing is how we leverage CIs to test whether a significant difference or relationship exists in the data. Sir Ronald Fisher invented what is known as the null hypothesis, which states that there is no relationship/difference; disprove me if you can! The null hypothesis is defined by:

$$ H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B $$

The objective of hypothesis testing is to determine if there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis always states that there is 'nothing' of significance. For example, if we want to test whether an intervention has an effect on an outcome in a population, the null hypothesis states that there is no effect. If we want to test whether there is a difference in average scores between two groups in a population, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference.

An alternative hypothesis may simply state that there is a difference or relationship in the population, or it may specify the expected direction (e.g., Population A has a significantly 'larger' or 'smaller' average value than Population B; Variable A is 'positively' or 'negatively' related to Variable B):

$$ H_A: \mu_A \neq \mu_B $$

$$ H_A: \mu_A < \mu_B $$

$$ H_A: \mu_A > \mu_B $$

  **Alpha**

  The alpha level of a hypothesis test, denoted by $\alpha$, represents the probability of obtaining observed results due to chance if the null hypothesis is true. In other words, $\alpha$ is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (and therefore claiming that there is a significant difference or relationship) when in fact we should have failed to reject it because there is insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
  
  $\alpha$ is often set at .05 but is sometimes set at a more rigorous .01. An $\alpha$ of .05 corresponds to a 95% CI (1 - .05), and .01 to a 99% CI (1 - .01). With non-directional alternative hypotheses, we must divide $\alpha$ by 2 (i.e., we could observe a significant result in either tail of the distribution), while one-tailed tests position the rejection region entirely within one tail based on what is being hypothesized. 
  
  At the .05 level, we would conclude that a finding is statistically significant if the chance of observing a value at least as extreme as the one observed is less than 1 in 20 if the null hypothesis is true. Note that we observed this behavior with our simulated distribution of sample means. In our example, we found that in 97 of 100 cases, the sample mean was within our 95% CI. While we can draw a more extreme value by chance with repeated attempts, we should only expect a mean outside the 95% CI less than 1 in every 20 times. Moreover, we should generally only expect a mean outside the 99% CI less than 1 in every 100 times.

  **Beta**
  
  Another key value is Beta, denoted by $\beta$, which relates to the power of the analysis. Simply put, power reflects our ability to find a difference or relationship if there is one. Power is calculated by 1 - $\beta$.
  
  **Type I & II Errors**

  A Type I Error is a false positive, wherein we conclude that there is a significant difference or relationship when there is not. A Type II Error is a false negative, wherein we fail to capture a significant finding. $\alpha$ represents our chance of making a Type I Error, while $\beta$ represents our chance of making a Type II Error. I once had a professor explain that committing a Type I error is a shame, while committing a Type II error is a pity, and I've found this to be a helpful way to remember what each type of error represents.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Type I and II Errors', fig.align = 'center'}

  **P-Values**
  
  In statistical tests, the p-value is referenced to determine whether the null hypothesis can be rejected. The p-value represents the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one observed if the null hypothesis is true. As a general rule, if p < .05, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the observed difference or relationship was unlikely a chance observation.

  While statistical significance helps us understand the probability of observing results by chance when there is actually no difference or effect in the population, it does not tell us anything about the size of the difference or effect. Analysis should never be reduced to inspecting p-values; in fact, p-values have been the subject of much controversy among researchers and practitioners in recent years. This book will cover how to interpret results of statistical tests to surface the story and determine if there is anything 'practically' significant among statistically significant findings.
  
## Exercises

1. Parameters are descriptions or characteristics of a sample, while statistics are descriptions or characteristics of a population.
   <br />A. True
   <br />B. False
   
2. Which of the following is an example of a null hypothesis, where “µ” reflects the mean of a population?
   <br />A. µA = µB
   <br />B. µA ≠ µB
   <br />C. µA < µB
   <br />D. µA  > µB
   <br />E. None of the above; all are examples of alternative hypotheses.
   
3. Which of the following describes a Type I Error?
   <br />A. Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false
   <br />B. Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true
   <br />C. Reporting something as significant when nothing of significance is present (a shame)
   <br />D. Failing to detect something of significance (a pity)
   <br />E. Both B and C
   <br />F. Both A and D

4. 100 randomly selected employees in the Marketing department of an organization participated in a survey on career pathing for marketing professionals. What is the sample and what is the population sampled in this case?
   <br />A. Sample: 100 employees who completed the survey, Population: All employees in the organization
   <br />B. Sample: 100 employees who completed the survey, Population: Marketing employees
   <br />C. Sample: All Marketing professionals, Population: All employees in the organization
   <br />D. Sample: All employees in the organization, Population: Employees across all companies globally

5. The primary purpose of inferential statistics is to make inferences about a population based on sample data. Inferential statistics allows these inferences to be made with defined levels of confidence that what is observed in a sample is also characteristic of the larger population.
   <br />A. True
   <br />B. False
   
6. The median tends to be a better measure of central tendency since the mean is more sensitive to extreme values (outliers)?
   <br />A. True
   <br />B. False

7. The standard deviation represents the 'average' amount by which individual values for a variable deviate (or vary) from the mean. A large standard deviation indicates there is considerable spread in the data, whereas a small standard deviation indicates the mean is fairly representative of the data.
   <br />A. True
   <br />B. False
   
8. A positively skewed distribution has its largest allocation to the left and a negative distribution to the right.
   <br />A. True
   <br />B. False

9. The mean alone is sufficient for understanding the distribution of a set of data.
   <br />A. True
   <br />B. False

10. Quartiles are useful for understanding the distribution of data.
   <br />A. True
   <br />B. False
