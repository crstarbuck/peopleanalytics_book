# Statistical Fundamentals

This chapter surveys a number of univariate, bivariate, and inferential analysis concepts that underpin the more complex multivariate approaches in subsequent chapters of this book.

## Populations & Samples

The goal of research is to understand a population based on data from a subset of population members. In practice, it is often not feasible to collect data from every member of a population, so sampling enables us to calculate statistics based on a smaller sample -- such as people willing to participate in a survey -- in order to learn about the parameters of the larger population.

Another important concept is the sampling frame. While the population represents the entire group of interest, the sampling frame represents the subset of the population to which the researcher has access. In an ideal setting, the population and sampling frame are the same, but they are often different in practice. For example, a professor may be interested in understanding student sentiment about a new school policy but only has access to collect data from students in the courses she teaches. In this case, the entire student body is the population but the students she has access to (those in the courses she teaches) represent the sampling frame. The sample is the subset of the sampling frame that ultimately participates in the research (e.g,. those who complete a survey or participate in a focus group).

## Univariate Analysis

Descriptive statistics are rudimentary analysis techniques that help describe and summarize data in a meaningful way. Descriptive statistics do not allow us to draw any conclusions beyond the available data but are helpful in interpreting the data at hand.

There are two categories of descriptive statistics: (1) measures of central tendency and (2) measures of spread. Measures of central tendency describe the central position in a set of data, while measures of spread describe how dispersed the data are.

### Measures of Central Tendency

  <b>Mean</b>
  
  Perhaps the most intuitive measure of central tendency is the mean, which is often referred to as the average. The mean of a sample is denoted by $\bar{x}$ and is defined by:
  
  $$ \bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n} $$

The mean of a set of numeric values can be calculated using the mean() function in R:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Fill vector x with integers
x <- c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,50)

# Calculate average of vector x
mean(x)

```

  <b>Median</b>
  
  The median represents the midpoint in a sorted vector of numbers. For vectors with an even number of values, the median is the average of the middle two numbers; it is simply the middle number for vectors with an odd number of values. When the distribution of data is skewed, or there is an extreme value like we observe in vector x, the median is a better measure of central tendency. 
  
  The median() function in R can be used to handle the sorting and midpoint selection:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate median of vector x
median(x)

```
  
  In this example, the median is only 2 compared with the mean of 6.9 (which is not really representative of any of the values in vector x). Large deltas between mean and median values are evidence of outliers.
  
  <b>Mode</b>
  
  The mode is the most frequent number in a set of values.
  
  While mean() and median() are standard functions in R, mode() returns the internal storage mode of the object rather than the statistical mode of the data. We can easily create a function to return the statistical mode(s):
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Create function to calculate statistical mode(s)
stat.mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  tab <- tabulate(match(x, ux))
  ux[tab == max(tab)]
}

# Return mode(s) of vector x
stat.mode(x)

```
  
  In this case, we have a bimodal distribution since both 1 and 2 occur most frequently.
  
  <b>Range</b>
  
  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a set of numbers. 
  
  The range() function in R returns the minimum and maximum numbers:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return lowest and highest values of vector x
range(x)

```

We can leverage the max() and min() functions to calculate the difference between these values:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate range of vector x
max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)

```

### Measures of Spread

  <b>Variance</b>
  
  Variance is a measure of the variability around the average value. Variance is calculated using the average of squared differences from the mean.
  
  Variance of a population is defined by:
  
  $$ \sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum (X_{i}-\mu)^{2}}{N} $$
  
  Variance of a sample is defined by:
  
  $$ s^{2} = \frac{\sum (x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1} $$
  
  It is important to note that since differences are squared, the variance is always non-negative. In addition, we cannot compare these squared differences to the arithmetic mean since the units are different. For example, if we calculate the variance of compensation measured in USD, variance should be expressed as USD squared while the mean exists in the original USD unit of measurement.
 
 In R, the sample variance can be calculated using the var() function:
 
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Read data
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crstarbuck/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/master/data/files/employee_demographics.csv")

# Calculate sample variance for compensation
var(data$annual_base_compensation)

```

  Sample statistics are the default in R. Since the population variance differs from the sample variance by a factor of `var(vector) * (n - 1) / n`, it is simple to convert output from var() to the population variance:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Store number of observations
n = nrow(data)

# Calculate population variance for compensation
var(data$annual_base_compensation) * (n - 1) / n

```

  <b>Standard Deviation</b>
  
  The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance, as defined by:
  
  $$ s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}}{N - 1}} $$
  
  Since a squared value can be converted back to its original units by taking its square root, the standard deviation expresses variability around the mean in the variable's original units.
  
   In R, the sample standard deviation can be calculated using the sd() function:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate sample standard deviation for compensation
sd(data$annual_base_compensation)

```

  Since the population standard deviation differs from the sample standard deviation by a factor of `sd(vector) * sqrt((n - 1) / n)`, it is simple to convert output from sd() to the population standard deviation:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate population standard deviation for compensation
sd(data$annual_base_compensation) * sqrt((n - 1) / n)

```

  <b>Quartiles</b>
  
  Quartiles are a staple of exploratory data analysis (EDA). A quartile is a type of quantile that partitions data into four equally sized parts (with regard to the number of data points in each quartile, not the range of values) after ordering the data. Quartiles also correspond to percentiles. For example, Q1 is the 25th percentile -- the value below which 25% of values exist.
  
  The Interquartile Range (IQR) represents the difference between Q3 and Q1 cutpoint values (the middle two quartiles). The IQR is sometimes used to detect extreme values in a distribution. Values less than `Q1 - 1.5 * IQR` or greater than `Q3 + 1.5 * IQR` are generally considered outliers.
  
  In R, the quantile() function returns the values that bookend each quartile:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return quartiles for compensation
quantile(data$annual_base_compensation)

```

  We can return a specific percentile value using the `probs` argument in the quantile() function:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return 80th percentile compensation value
quantile(data$annual_base_compensation, probs = .8)

```

  In addition, the summary() function returns several common descriptive statistics for an object:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Return common descriptives
summary(data$annual_base_compensation)

```

### Bivariate Analysis  

  <b>Covariance</b>

$$ cov_{x,y} = \frac{\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})}{N-1} $$

  <b>Correlation</b>

  "Correlation is not causation."

$$ r_{x,y} = \frac{\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_(x_{i}-\bar{x})^2\sum_(y_{i}-\bar{y})^2}} $$

## Inferential Statistics

The objective of inferential statistics is to make inferences -- with some degree of confidence -- about a population based on available sample data. Several related concepts underpin this goal and will be covered here.

### Introduction to Probability



### Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a mainstay of statistics and probability and fundamental to understanding the mechanics of inferential analysis techniques we will cover later in this book. The CLT was initially coined by a French-born mathematician named Abraham De Moivre in the 1700s. While initially unpopular, it was later reintroduced and attracted new interest from theorists and academics (Daw & Pearson, 1972). 

The CLT states that the average of independent random variables, when increased in number, tend to follow a normal distribution. The distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution regardless of the shape of the population distribution from which the samples are drawn. This is important because the normal distribution has properties that can be used to test the likelihood that an observed difference or relationship in a sample is also present in the population.

If we need to estimate the average value of a population, for example, we can lean on the CLT and normal distribution properties to obtain the range of values that are likely to include the true population average. This is how confidence intervals are defined, which enable us to make reasonable inferences about the unknown population parameters based on sample data.

<br />

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'The Empirical Rule', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/normal_distribution.png")

```

<br />

Let's begin with an intuitive example of CLT. Imagine that we have a reliable way to measure how fun a population is on a 100-point scale, where 100 indicates maximum fun (life of the party) and 1 indicates relative boringness. Consider that a small statistics conference is in progress at a nearby convention center, and there are 40 statisticians in attendance. In a separate room at the same convention center, there is also a group of 40 random people (non-statisticians) who are gathered to discuss some less interesting topic. Our job is to walk into one of the rooms and determine -- on the basis of the "fun" factor alone -- whether we have entered the statistics conference or the other, less interesting gathering of non-statisticians.

Let's assume the mean fun score and standard deviation of these two groups are known; the group of statisticians have, on average, a fun score of 85 with a standard deviation of 2, while the group of non-statisticians are a bit less fun with a mean score of 65 and a standard deviation of 4. With a known population mean and standard deviation, the standard error (the standard deviation of the sample means) provides the ability to calculate the probability that the sample (the room of 40 people) belongs to the population of interest (fellow statisticians).

Herein lies the beauty of the CLT: roughly 68 percent of sample means will lie within one standard error of the population mean, roughly 95 percent within two standard errors of the population mean, and roughly 99 percent within three standard errors of the population mean. Therefore, any room whose members have an average fun score that is not within two standard errors of the population mean (between 81 and 89 for our statisticians) is statistically unlikely to be the group of statisticians for which we are searching. This is because in less than 5 in 100 cases could we randomly draw a 'reasonably sized' sample of statisticians with average funness so extremely different from the population average. 

Because small samples lend to anamalies, we could -- by chance -- select a single person who happens to fall in the tails (relatively boring or extremely fun); however, as the sample size increases, it becomes more and more likely that the observed average reflects the average of the larger population. It would be virtually impossible (in less than 1 in 100 cases) to draw a random sample of statisticians from the population with average funness that is not within three standard errors of the population mean (between 79 and 91). Therefore, if we find that the room of people have an average fun score of 75, we will likely have far more fun in the other room!

Let's now see the CLT in action by simulating a random uniform population distribution from which we can draw random samples. Remember, the shape of the population distribution does not matter; we could simulate an Exponential, Gamma, Poisson, Binomial, or other distribution and observe the same behavior.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Load libraries for data wrangling and viz
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Set seed for reproducible random distribution
set.seed(1234)

# Generate uniform population distribution with 1000 values ranging from 1 to 100
rand.unif <- runif(1000, min = 1, max = 100)

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate population mean
mean(rand.unif)

```

```{r, fig.cap = "Uniform Population Distribution (N = 1000)", fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE}

# Produce histogram to visualize population distribution
ggplot() + 
  aes(rand.unif) + 
  labs(x = "x", y = "N") + 
  geom_histogram(colour = "white", size = .1, fill = "#262626")

```

As expected, these randomly generated data are uniformly distributed. Next, we will draw 100 random samples of various sizes and plot the average of each.

```{r, fig.cap = "Distribution of 100 Sample Means of Varied Size", fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE}

# Define number of samples to draw from population distribution
samples <- 100

# Populate vector with sample sizes
sample_n <- c(1:5,10,25,50)

# Initialize empty data frame to hold sample means
sample_means = NULL

# Set seed for reproducible random samples
set.seed(456)

# For each n, draw random samples
for (n in sample_n) {
  
  for (draw in 1:samples) {
    
      # Store sample means in data frame
      sample_means <- rbind(sample_means, cbind.data.frame(
                            n = n, 
                            x_bar = mean(sample(rand.unif, n, replace = TRUE, prob = NULL))))
  }
}

# Produce histograms to visualize distributions of sample means
sample_means %>% ggplot() + 
  aes(x = x_bar, fill = n) + 
  labs(x = "x-bar", y = "n") + 
  geom_histogram(colour = "white", size = .1, fill = "#262626") + 
  facet_wrap(~n)

```

Per the CLT, we can see that as n increases, the sample means become more normally distributed.

### Confidence Intervals

  A Confidence Interval (CI) is a range of values that likely includes an unknown population value, as defined by:
  
  $$ CI = \bar{X} \pm z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$
  
  A related concept that is fundamental to estimating CIs is the standard error. The standard error (SE) is the standard deviation of sample means. While the standard deviation is a measure of variability for random variables, the variability captured by the SE reflects how representative the sample is of the population. Since sample statistics will approach the actual population parameters as the size of the sample increases, the SE and sample size are inversely related; that is, the SE decreases as the sample size increases. The SE is defined by:
  
  $$ SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} $$
  
  Next, let's validate that our simulated distribution of sample means adheres to the properties of normally distributed data per the Empirical Rule:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Store sample means with n = 50
x_bars <- sample_means[sample_means$n == 50, "x_bar"]

# Store sample size
n <- length(x_bars)

# Calculate percent of sample means within +/- 2 SEs
length(x_bars[x_bars < mean(x_bars) + 2 * sd(x_bars) & x_bars > mean(x_bars) - 2 * sd(x_bars)]) / n * 100

```

  97% of sample means are within 2 SEs, which is roughly what we expect per the characteristics of the normal distribution. 
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate percent of sample means within +/- 3 SEs
length(x_bars[x_bars < mean(x_bars) + 3 * sd(x_bars) & x_bars > mean(x_bars) - 3 * sd(x_bars)]) / n * 100

```

  All of the sample means are within 3 SEs, indicating that it would be highly unlikely -- nearly impossible even -- to observe a sample mean `from the same population` that falls outside this interval.
  
  Now, let's illustrate the relationship between CIs and standard errors:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate 95% CI
ci95_lower_bound <- mean(x_bars) - 1.96 * (sd(x_bars) / sqrt(n))
ci95_upper_bound <- mean(x_bars) + 1.96 * (sd(x_bars) / sqrt(n))

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print lower bound for 95% CI
ci95_lower_bound

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print upper bound for 95% CI
ci95_upper_bound

```
  
  The 95% CI corresponds to a z-score of 1.96, which is simply the number of SEs we expect to include the true population average -- at least in 95 of 100 random samples taken from said population. In this example, we know that our population mean is 51.2, which is covered by our 95% CI (50.8 - 52.3). Note that our CI narrows with larger samples since our confidence that the range includes the population average increases with more data.

  Next, let's look at a 99% CI. We will use a z-score of 2.58 for this:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Calculate 99% CI
ci99_lower_bound <- mean(x_bars) - 2.58 * (sd(x_bars) / sqrt(n))
ci99_upper_bound <- mean(x_bars) + 2.58 * (sd(x_bars) / sqrt(n))

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print lower bound for 99% CI
ci99_lower_bound

```

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Print upper bound for 99% CI
ci99_upper_bound

```
  
  Like the 95% CI, this slightly wider 99% CI (50.5 - 52.5) also includes the true population mean of 51.2.
  
  <b>Hypothesis Testing</b>

Hypothesis testing is how we leverage CIs to test whether a significant difference or relationship exists in the data. Sir Ronald Fisher invented what is known as the null hypothesis, which states that there is no relationship/difference; disprove me if you can! The null hypothesis is defined by:

$$ H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B $$

The objective of hypothesis testing is to determine if there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis always states that there is 'nothing' of significance. For example, if we want to test whether an intervention has an effect on an outcome in a population, the null hypothesis states that there is no effect. If we want to test whether there is a difference in average scores between two groups in a population, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference.

An alternative hypothesis may simply state that there is a difference or relationship in the population, or it may specify the expected direction (e.g., Population A has a significantly 'larger' or 'smaller' average value than Population B; Variable A is 'positively' or 'negatively' related to Variable B):

$$ H_A: \mu_A \neq \mu_B $$

$$ H_A: \mu_A < \mu_B $$

$$ H_A: \mu_A > \mu_B $$

  <b>Alpha</b>

  The alpha level of a hypothesis test, denoted by $\alpha$, represents the probability of obtaining observed results due to chance if the null hypothesis is true. In other words, $\alpha$ is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (and therefore claiming that there is a significant difference or relationship) when in fact we should have failed to reject it because there is insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
  
  $\alpha$ is often set at .05 but is sometimes set at a more rigorous .01. An $\alpha$ of .05 corresponds to a 95% CI (1 - .05), and .01 to a 99% CI (1 - .01). With non-directional alternative hypotheses, we must divide $\alpha$ by 2 (i.e., we could observe a significant result in either tail of the distribution), while one-tailed tests position the rejection region entirely within one tail based on what is being hypothesized. 
  
  At the .05 level, we would conclude that a finding is statistically significant if the chance of observing a value at least as extreme as the one observed is less than 1 in 20 if the null hypothesis is true. Note that we observed this behavior with our simulated distribution of sample means. In our example, we found that in 97 of 100 cases, the sample mean was within our 95% CI. While we can draw a more extreme value by chance with repeated attempts, we should only expect a mean outside the 95% CI less than 1 in every 20 times. Moreover, we should generally only expect a mean outside the 99% CI less than 1 in every 100 times.

  <b>Beta</b>
  
  Another key value is Beta, denoted by $\beta$, which relates to the power of the analysis. Simply put, power reflects our ability to find a difference or relationship if there is one. Power is calculated by 1 - $\beta$.
  
  <b>Type I & II Errors</b>

  A Type I Error is a false positive, wherein we conclude that there is a significant difference or relationship when there is not. A Type II Error is a false negative, wherein we fail to capture a significant finding. $\alpha$ represents our chance of making a Type I Error, while $\beta$ represents our chance of making a Type II Error. I once had a professor explain that committing a Type I error is a shame, while committing a Type II error is a pity, and I've found this to be a helpful way to remember what each type of error represents.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Type I and II Errors', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/hypothesis_testing_errors.png")

```

  <b>P-Values</b>
  
  In statistical tests, the p-value is referenced to determine whether the null hypothesis can be rejected. The p-value represents the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one observed if the null hypothesis is true. As a general rule, if p < .05, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the observed difference or relationship was unlikely a chance observation.

  While statistical significance helps us understand the probability of observing results by chance when there is actually no difference or effect in the population, it does not tell us anything about the size of the difference or effect. Analysis should never be reduced to inspecting p-values; in fact, p-values have been the subject of much controversy among researchers and practitioners in recent years. This book will cover how to interpret results of statistical tests to surface the story and determine if there is anything 'practically' significant among statistically significant findings.
