# Measurement & Sampling {#measure-sampl}

## Populations & Samples

The goal of research is to understand a population based on data from a subset of population members. In practice, it is often not feasible to collect data from every member of a population, so we instead calculate **sample statistics** to estimate **population parameters**.

Another important concept is the **sampling frame**. While the population represents the entire group of interest, the sampling frame represents the subset of the population to which the researcher has access. In an ideal setting, the population and sampling frame are the same, but they are often different in practice. For example, a professor may be interested in understanding student sentiment about a new school policy but only has access to collect data from students in the courses she teaches. In this case, the entire student body is the population but the students she has access to (those in the courses she teaches) represent the sampling frame. The sample is the subset of the sampling frame that ultimately participates in the research (e.g,. those who complete a survey or participate in a focus group).
