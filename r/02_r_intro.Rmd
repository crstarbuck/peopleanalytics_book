# Introduction to R {#r-intro}

  This chapter covers how to install R, R Studio, and required packages for replicating examples in this book. This chapter also covers R basics such as objects, data structures, and data types that are fundamental to working in R. In addition, many common functions will be covered in this chapter, and many more will be introduced thoughout later chapters.

## Getting Started

  Run and test your code frequently. Writing a significant number of lines before testing will make debugging your code far more difficult and time-intensive than it needs to be. 

  **Installing R**

  R can be compiled and ran on a variety of platforms including UNIX, Windows, and MacOS. R can be downloaded here: https://www.r-project.org/
  
  When installing R, you will need to select a CRAN mirror. The **Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)** is a network of servers around the world that store identical, current versions of code and documentation for R. You should select the CRAN mirror nearest you to minimize network load.

  **Installing R Studio**

  **R Studio** is an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** for R. R Studio provides a console with syntax editing that is helpful for debugging code as well as tools for plotting, history, and workspace management. Both open source and commercial editions are available, but the open source option is sufficient for replicating everything in this book.
  
  R Studio can be downloaded here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

  **Installing Packages**

  Libraries from several R packages will be utilized in this book. The line of code below can be executed within R or R Studio to install all at once:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "corrplot", "psych", "moments", "ggpubr", "GGally", "sqldf", "caret"), dependencies = TRUE, repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

```

  **Case Sensitivity**

  It's important to note that everything in R is case-sensitive. When working with functions, be sure to match the case when typing the function name. For example, `Mean()` is not the same as `mean()`; since `mean()` is the correct case for the function, capitalized characters will result in an error when executing the function.
  
  **Help**
  
  Documentation for functions is available via the `?` command. This can be inserted prior to any function to access the function's documentation. For example, `?mean` will display the documentation, including its required and optional arguments, for the `mean()` function.
  
```{r r-help, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Documentation for Arithmetic Mean Function', fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/craig.starbuck/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/People Analytics Book/GitHub/peopleanalytics_lifecycle_book/graphics/r_help.png")

```
  
  **Objects**
  
  Objects underpin just about everything we do in R. An object is a container for various types of data. Objects can take many forms, ranging from simple objects holding a single number or character to complex structures that support advanced visualizations. The assignment character `<-` is used to assign values to an object.
  
  Let's use the assignment operator to assign a number and character to separate objects. Note that non-numeric values must be enveloped in either single ticks `''` or double quotes `""`:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

obj_1 <- 1
obj_1

```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

obj_2 <- 'a'
obj_2

```  
  
  Several functions are available for returning the type of data in an object:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

typeof(obj_2)

``` 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

class(obj_2)

```    

  **Comments**
  
  The `#` symbol is used for commenting/annotating code. This is a best practice to aid in quickly and easily deciphering the role of each line or block of code. Without comments, troubleshooting large scripts can be a more challenging task than necessary.
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Assign a new number to the object named obj_1
obj_1 <- 2
# Display value in obj_1
obj_1

```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Assign a new character to the object named obj_2
obj_2 <- 'b'
# Display value in obj_2
obj_2

``` 

  In-line code comments can also be added where needed to reduce the number of lines in a script:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Assign a new number to the object named obj_1
obj_1 <- 3
obj_1 # Display value in obj_1

```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Assign a new character to the object named obj_2
obj_2 <- 'c' 
obj_2 # Display value in obj_2

``` 

## Vectors

  A **vector** is the most basic data object in R. Vectors contain a collection of data elements of the same data type. For example, a vector may contain a series of numbers, set of characters, collection of dates, or logical `TRUE` or `FALSE` results.
  
  In this example, we introduce the combine function `c()`, which allows us to fill an object with more than one value:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create and fill a numeric vector named vect_num
vect_num <- c(2,4,6,8,10)
vect_num

```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create and fill a character vector named vect_char
vect_char <- c('a','b','c')
vect_char

```  

  We can use the `as.Date()` function to convert character strings containing dates to an actual date data type. By default, anything within single ticks or double quotes is treated as a character, so we must make an **explicit type conversion** from characters to dates. Remember that R is case-sensitive. Therefore, `as.date()` is not a valid function; the `D` must be capitalized.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create and fill a date vector named vect_dt
vect_dt <- c(as.Date("2021-01-01"), as.Date("2022-01-01"))
vect_dt

``` 

  We can use the sequence generation function `seq()` to fill values between a start and end point using a specified interval. For example, we can fill `vect_dt` with the first day of each month between `2021-01-01` and `2022-01-01` via the `seq()` function and its `by = "months"` argument:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create and fill a date vector named vect_dt
vect_dt <- seq(as.Date("2021-01-01"), as.Date("2022-01-01"), by = 'months')
vect_dt

``` 
  
  We can also use the `:` operator to fill integers between a starting and ending number:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create and fill a numeric vector with values between 1 and 10
vect_num <- 1:10
vect_num

``` 

  We can access a particular element of a vector using its index. An **index** represents the position in a set of elements. In R, the first element of a vector has an index of 1, and the final element of a vector has an index equal to the vector's length. The index is specified using square brackets, such as `[5]` for the fifth element of a vector.
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Return the value in position 5 of vect_num
vect_num[5]

```  

  When applied to a vector, the `length()` function returns the number of elements in the vector, and this can be used to dynamically return the last value of vectors.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Return the last element of vect_num
vect_num[length(vect_num)]

```  

  **Vectorized Operations**
  
  **Vectorized operations (or vectorization)** underpin mathematical operations in R and greatly simplify computation. For example, if we need to perform a mathematical operation to each data element in a numeric vector, we do not need to specify each and every element explicitly. We can simply apply the operation at the vector level, and the operation will be applied to each of the vector's individual elements.
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create a numeric vector named x and fill with values between 1 and 10
x <- 1:10

```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Add 2 to each element of x
x_plus2 <- x+2
x_plus2

```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Multiply each element of x by 2
x_times2 <- x*2
x_times2

```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Square each element of x
x_sq <- x^2
x_sq

```  

  Many built-in arithmetic functions are available and compatible with vectors:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Aggregate sum of x elements
sum(x)

```  

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Count of x elements
length(x)

```  

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Square root of x elements
sqrt(x)

```  

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Natural logarithm of x elements
log(x)

```  

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Exponential of x elements
exp(x)

```  

  We can also perform various operations on multiple vectors. Vectorization will result in an implied ordering about the elements, in that the specified operation will be applied to the first elements of the vectors and then the second, then third, etc.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create vectors x1 and x2 and fill with integers
x1 <- 1:10
x2 <- 11:20

# Store sum of vectors to new x3 vector
x3 <- x1 + x2
x3

```  

  Using vectorization, we can also evaluate whether a specified condition is true or false for each element in a vector:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Evaluate whether each element of x is less than 6, and store results to a logical vector
logical_rslts <- x<6
logical_rslts

``` 

## Matrices

  A **matrix** is similar to a vector in that it represents a collection of data elements of the same data type; however, the elements of a matrix are *arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns*.

  We can create a matrix using the `matrix()` function. Per `?matrix`, the `nrow` and `ncol` arguments can be used to organize like data elements into a specified number of rows and columns.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create and fill matrix with numbers
mtrx_num <- matrix(data = 1:10, nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
mtrx_num

``` 

  We can leverage shorthand for function calls. As long as the argument values are in the correct order by the documentation, the argument names are not required. Per `?matrix`, the first argument is `data`, followed by `nrow` and then `ncol`. Therefore, we can achieve the same result using the following:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create and fill matrix with numbers
mtrx_num <- matrix(1:10, 5, 2)
mtrx_num

``` 
  
  Several functions are available to quickly retrieve the number of rows and columns in a rectangular object like a matrix:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Return the number of rows in mtrx_num
nrow(mtrx_num)

``` 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Return the number of columns in mtrx_num
ncol(mtrx_num)

``` 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Return the number of columns and rows in mtrx_num
dim(mtrx_num)

``` 

  The `head()` and `tail()` functions return the first and last pieces of data, respectively. For large matrices (or other types of objects), this can be helpful for previewing the data:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Return the first five rows of the matrix
head(matrix(1:10000, 1000, 10), 5)

``` 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Return the last five rows of the matrix
tail(matrix(1:10000, 1000, 10), 5)

``` 

## Factors

  A **factor** is a data structure containing a finite number of categorical values. Each categorical value of a factor is known as a **level**, and the levels can be either ordered or unordered. This data structure is a requirement for several statistical models we will cover in later chapters.
  
  We can create a factor using the `factor()` function:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create and fill factor with unordered categories
education <- factor(c("undergraduate", "post-graduate", "graduate"))
education

```   

  Since education has an inherent ordering, we can use the `ordered` and `levels` arguments of the `factor()` function to order the categories:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create and fill factor with unordered categories
education <- factor(education, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("undergraduate", "graduate", "post-graduate"))
education

``` 

  The ordering of factors is critical to a correct interpretation of statistical model output as we will cover later.

## Data Frames
  
  A *data frame* is similar to a matrix in that it organizes elements within rows and columns but unlike matrices, data frames can store multiple types of data. Data frames are often the most appropriate data structures for the data required in people analytics.
  
  A data frame can be created using the `data.frame()` function:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create three vectors containing integers (x), characters (y), and dates (z)
x <- 1:10
y <- c('a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j')
z <- seq(as.Date("2021-01-01"), as.Date("2021-10-01"), by = 'months')

# Create a data frame with 3 columns (vectors x, y, and z) and 10 rows
df <- data.frame(x, y, z)
df

``` 

  The data type of each vector in a data frame object can be viewed using the `str()` function:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Describe the structure of df
str(df)

``` 

  Specific columns in the data frame can be referenced using the `$` symbol between the data frame and column names:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Return data in column x in df
df$x

```   

  Another method that allows for efficient subsetting of rows and/or columns is the `subset()` function. The example below illustrates how to subset `df` using conditions on `x` and `y` while only displaying `z` in the output:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Return z values for rows where x is at least 7 OR y is a, b, or c.
subset(df, x >= 7 | y == c('a','b','c'), select = z)

```

## Lists

  **Lists** are versatile objects that can contain elements with different types and lengths. The elements of a list can be vectors, matrices, data frames, functions, or even other lists.
  
  A list can be created using the `list()` function:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Store vectors x, y, and z as well as df to a list
lst <- list(x, y, z, df)
str(lst)

```  

  Unlike vectors, accessing elements of a list requires double brackets, such as `[[3]]` for the third element.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Return data from the third element of lst
lst[[3]]

```  

## Loops

  In many cases, the need arises to perform an operation a variable number of times. Loops are available to avoid the cumbersome task of writing the same statement many times. The two most common types of loops are `while` and `for` loops.
  
  Let's use a `while` loop to square integers between 1 and 5:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Initialize variable
i <- 1

# Using a 'while' loop, square the values 1 through 5 and print results to the screen
# 'i' is a variable that takes on a value between 1 and 5 for the respective loop
while (i < 6) {
  
  print(i^2) 
  i <- i + 1 # increment i by 1
  
}

```    

  With a `while` loop, we needed to initialize the variable `i` as well as increment it by `1` within the loop. With a `for` loop, we can accomplish the same goal with less code:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Using a 'for' loop, square the values 1 through 5 and print results to the screen
for (i in 1:5) { 
  
  print(i^2)
  
}

```  

## User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

  Though many built-in functions are available, R provides the flexibility to create our own. In fact, many functions used in this book are actually functions of functions.
  
  Functions can be an effective alternative to loops. For example, here is a basic function that achieves the same goal as our `while` and `for` loop examples (i.e., squaring integers 1 through 5):
 
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Create a function named square.val() with one argument (x) that squares given x values
square.val <- function(x) {
  
  x^2
}

# Pass integers 1 through 5 into the new square.val() function and display results
square.val(1:5)

``` 

  While many projects warrant UDFs and/or loops, we do not actually need either to square a set of integers. As you gain experience writing R code, you will naturally discover ways to write more performant and terse code:
  
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Square integers
(1:5)^2

```  

## Graphics

  While base R has native plotting capabilities, we will use the more flexibile and sophisticated visualization capabilities within the `ggplot2` library in this book. We can load the `ggplot2` library using the `library()` function:
  
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Load library for data viz
library(ggplot2)

```

  When working with functions beyond what is available in base R, entering `::` between the library and function name is a best practice for efficient coding. R Studio will provide a menu of available functions within the specified library upon typing `library_name::`.
  
  The `ggplot2` library contains many types of visualizations. For example, we can build a line chart to show how the values of vector `x` relate to values of vector `y` in a data frame named `data`:

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Create data frame containing two related vectors
x <- 1:10
y <- (1:10)^2
data <- as.data.frame(cbind(x, y))

# Produce line chart
ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
ggplot2::geom_line()

``` 

  Furthermore, we can use `ggplot` parameters and themes to adjust the aesthetics of visuals:
  
```{r, message = FALSE}

# Produce line chart
ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
ggplot2::geom_line(size = .4, colour = "blue") + # Reduce line thickness and change color to blue
ggplot2::theme_bw() + # Remove the default grey background
ggplot2::ggtitle("Plot Title \n Split between Two Lines") + # Assign a title
ggplot2::xlab("Variable x Name") + # Label the x-axis
ggplot2::ylab("Variable y Name") + # Label the y-axis
ggplot2::theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # Center plot title

```
